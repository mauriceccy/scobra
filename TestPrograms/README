### Test function 
### Created by Kristoforus 26/02/2018

This folder contains files that either 1) run tests on scobra functions or 2) contains functions that help in making the test functions. 

There are five different test functions: Model.py, MOMA_and_ROOM.py, Scan.py, FVA.py, FCA.py. 

#Model.py, FVA.py, FCA.py uses a stream-lined model found in sample/testmodel.xls. 
#MOMA_and_ROOM.py and Scan.py uses the model found in sample/Diel_Leaf_Model_cleaned.xls as the stream-lined model (which only includes the reactions that are constituent of a MinFluxSolve solution) does not provide enough complexity for these tests. 

The tests runs the majority of the scobra functions that exist, with reasonable exclusion of 1) functions that are already called in another function 2) functions that takes too long to evaluate (e.g. FCA, Constraint2DScan, DeadMetabolites).  

Calling scobra.test() will run test.py in this directory. test.py runs every functions mentioned above with the exception of FCA as it takes too long (7-8 minutes). This test is normally completed in less than 3 minutes.
One can test for FCA by running scobra.test(FCA=True).
