Description: # scobra
        
        Scobra is a supplementary package for COBRApy designed by Maurice Cheung used by the Yale-NUS Computational and Systems Biology team. This version is specifically for Python 3.
        
        To install scobra, run this line:
        
        pip install scobra -r requirements.txt
        
        ## Accessing scobra through the server using Jupyter Notebook 
        0. Make sure [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install) is installed in your local machine <br/>
        1. Connect to the server using your account <br/>
        ```
        ssh your_username@172.25.20.52
        ```
        2. Activate Jupyter Notebook in the server<br/>
        ``` 
        jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889
        ```
        3. Connect your local machine to the remote jupyter notebook session <br/>
        ```
        ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 your_username@172.25.20.52
        ```
        4. Open your browser and access <br/>
        ```
        localhost:8888
        ```
        5. If this is the first time your browser opens the session, you may need to provide a token. The token is displayed in your terminal running jupyter notebook remotely. It should look something like this: <br/>
        ```
        Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time, to login with a token:
                http://localhost:8889/?token=779c5074bbe9c26338a8760875e0c0ba3f77294201f61353
        ```
        Copy everything after `http://localhost:8889/?token=` to the box provided and login. <br/>
        
        ## Copying files to and from server 
        To copy files from local machine to server, run: 
        ```
        scp path/to/local/file username@172.25.20.52:path/to/remote/directory
        ```
        
        To copy files from server to local machine, run: 
        ```
        scp username@172.25.20.52:path/to/remote/directory path/to/local/file
        ```
        Note: to copy folders, use `scp -r` instead of `scp`
