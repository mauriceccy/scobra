# Python Version Requirement
Scobra requires Python version >= 3.6.
To check your Python version, open terminal and run:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If your Python version is lower than 3.6, install newer Python version from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

# Installing Scobra Dependencies

Download the _requirements.txt_ file, and navigate your terminal to the folder containing _requirements.txt_.
For example, if I download the _requirements.txt_ and place it in _Documents/Scobra/requirements.txt_, then I would open terminal and use the following command to naviage to the folder containing _requirements.txt_:

```bash
cd Documents/Scobra
```

Then, use the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Installing Scobra

Once, the dependencies are installed, install the latest version of _Scobra_ by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install scobra
```

# Running the Tutorial
Download all the files in the _tutorial_ folder. The _scobra_tutorial.ipynb_ contains a series of examples that demonstrate how to use the _scobra_ package. To run .ipynb or Interactive Python Notebook files, we recommend using the _Jupyter Notebook_.


To install _Jupyter Notebook_, run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install notebook
```

After installation is done, run the following command to open _Jupyter Notebook_ session on your browser:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Once opened, navigate to the _scobra_tutorial.ipynb_ file and open it.
