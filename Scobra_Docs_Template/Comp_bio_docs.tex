\begin{abstract}
The following is a brief documentation of the basic functionality of the scobrapy package for the Yale-NUS Computational and Systems Biology team. Scobrapy was designed by Maurice Cheung as a supplementary package to the basic functionality of cobrapy, and thus this documentation is best read in conjunction with the cobrapy documentation.
