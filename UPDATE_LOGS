10/01/2018: Test program for GeometricFBA.py: 
- Cannot find optimal solution at line32 after model was modified by SetObjAsConstraint function called in line 31.

10/01/2018: Test program for Graph.py: 
- DeadMetabolites function depends on FVA. FVA functions does not work when the cobra argument is False. The function is modified to allow cobra=True to be passed. 

10/01/2018: Test program for FVA.py
- The function FVA does not work when cobra is set to its default False value. The multiprocessing function called runs for too long.
- Fixes to the code that is handling the case where the argument cobra=True. This is due to incompatibility to the pandas DataFrame structure.
- Function AllFluxRange also runs into a multiprocessing function that takes too long. Functions FluxVariability and InternalCycles depends on it. 	

10/01/2018: Test program for ROOM.py: 
- All functions are working properly

10/01/2018: Test program for FluxSum.py: 
- All functions are working properly 

10/01/2018: Test program for Scan.py: 
- All functions are working properly

10/01/2018: Test program for RWFM.py: 
- All functions are working properly.

10/01/2018: Test program for MinSolve.py: 
- All functions are working properly.

10/01/2018: Test program for MOMA.py 
- Fixes to CleanUpTempVar function: commenting of lines of code that tries to assign values to x and y attributes of a Solution object. There is no setter for this attribute, hence assigning invokes attribute error. To access similar data, retrieve them from the attributes x_dict and y_dict instead. 
- Changes in syntax in CleanUpTempVar function: error was invoked when model.solution.x_dict was compared to None. This is because it compares all the values of model.solution.x_dict to None, which generates an array of booleans instead of one boolean required by the if function. This fixed by comparing the length of model.solution.x_dict to 0. 



09/01/2018: Test program for Pareto.py
- Fixes to the code at line 55. Assign rv.UpdateFromDic(sol) back in to rv.
- Functions are working, but the result given looks wrong. 

09/01/2018
- Changes to SetState function in model.py. This the new cobra version that does not include 'solution' as an attribute of the Model class. 




08/01/2018: Tested for FCA.py 
- All functions are working
- Addition of {} argument to what originally is 'rv = fva(bounds=self.bounds)' so it becomes 'rv = fva({}, bounds=self.bounds)' in FVA.py 

08/01/2018: Test program for fva.py
- Addition of parameter content on the __init__ function. The code originally does not create fva that can display dict. 
- Addition of {} argument to what originally is 'rv = fva(bounds=self.bounds)' so it becomes 'rv = fva({}, bounds=self.bounds)'
- Deletion of unecessary self argument in FluxRangeDiff function

08/01/2018: Test program for fca.py
- All functions are working 

08/01/2018: Test program for pareto.py 
- Syntax error in appending pandas Series into pandas DataFrame
- All other functions are working

08/01/2018: Test program for matrix.py
- Unable to test FluxRange: incompatible data structure demanded by the fva function
- Syntax error in ResponsCoef function
- All other functions are working 

08/01/2018: Test program for flux.py
- All functions are working

19/12/2017: Updates + Test Program for model.py and modelTest.py
- import deletion instead of double_deletion that is not found in cobra 0.10.0a1 (model.py and modelTest.py)
- Removal of unnecessary parameters: quadratic_component in optimize() and method in remove_from_model() (model.py and modelTest.py) 
- Removal of unnecessary parameter: add_to_containter_model in add_metabolites() (model.py and modelTest.py) 
- confusion between GetReacName and GetMetName in RatioScan and RatioRandomMinFluxScan functions (Scan.py)
- excessive parameter rev in RatioScan and RatioRandomMinFluxScan (Scan.py)
- 'PhasePlane' functions commented out, incompatible with cobra 0.10.0: calculate_phenotype_phase_plane function not found (model.py and modelTest.py) 
- Changes in SingleDeletion and DoubleDeletion functions (model.py and modelTest.py)
- Changes in WriteNetwork and WriteAttributes functions (model.py and modelTest.py) 
- Removal of len(self.reactions) from SetQuadraticObjective method: invalid Type error invoked in scipy (model.py and modelTest.py)
- Removal of unnecessary mutant_model from MOMA2mutant function (model.py and modelTest.py) 
- Changes in MOMA2mutant function (model.py and modelTest.py) 
- Changes in EssentialGenes and Essential Reactions following changes in single deletion (model.py and modelTest.py) 

There are still several unresolved issues that may cause errors in the testing. 
From model.py
- qp solver (e.g. cplex) requirement not met -> 'MOMA2mutant' Functions does not work
- no code written for MatchFlux, MatchRatio and Match Scan functions 
- 'SolsDiff' -> are sol1 and sol2 their fluxes???
- Function PhasePlane not coded
- Problems with 'FluxRangeDiff', 'FluxDiffDirec', and 'FluxRangeOverlap' 
Functions

From matrix.py
- python-tk module cannot be installed in virtual environment. Using Jupyter Notebook resolves the problem.

From FVA.py
- The function FVA does not work when the keyword argument cobra is set to its default False value. The multiprocessing function called runs for too long.
- Function AllFluxRange also runs into a multiprocessing function that takes too long. Functions FluxVariability and InternalCycles depends on it. 	

From GeometricFBA.py 
- Cannot find optimal solution at line32 after model was modified by SetObjAsConstraint function called in line 31.
