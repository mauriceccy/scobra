/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Chlorogenic acids (CGAs) are a group of soluble phenolic compounds that are produced by a variety of plants, including |FRAME: TAX-49390 "<i>Coffea canephora</i> (robusta coffee)"|.
/
/CGAs include esters formed between certain hydroxycinnamic acids and quinate or its derivative shikimate. The most common CGA compound is 5-caffeoylquinate (5-CQA) |CITS: [17333503]|. Other main groups of CGAs identified in green coffee beans include other CQA isomers, as well as dicaffeoylquinic and feruloylquinic acid isomers |CITS: [12861362]|.
/
/CGAs fulfil various physiological roles in plants. For example, they are known to be involved in the protection of plants from abiotic stresses such as UV damage |CITS:[Burchard00]| and in increased resistance to bacterial infections |CITS: [15107863]|.
/
/Biosynthesis of 5-CQA can be catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP98A36. However, that enzyme can only hydroxylate the chlorogenic acid precursor |FRAME: 4-COUMAROYLQUINATE "4-coumaroyl quinate"|. Another enzyme, CYP98A35, is able to metabolize both |FRAME: 4-COUMAROYLQUINATE "4-coumaroyl quinate"| and |FRAME: CPD-412| with the same efficiency. 
/
/CGA biosynthesis and accumulation occurred mainly in the shoot tip and in the phloem of the vascular bundles. The biosynthetic activity of chlorogenic acids was clearly reduced in ripening and ripe seeds, especially in |FRAME: TAX-49390| |CITS: [18069248]|. An alternate pathway for CGA biosynthesis is described in |FRAME: PWY-6040|.

COMMENT - Fatty acids constitute a major component of plant membranes in the form of glycerolipids, mainly 
/phosphoglycerolipids and glycosylglycerolipids. The majority of them have C16 or C18 carbon chains 
/and are attached to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. In Arabidopsis, the major 
/fatty acids are C16:0, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3. Unsaturated fatty acids are 
/significant to membrane functions such as photosynthesis and cold tolerance. C16:3 and C18:3 
/together make up more than 90% of the fatty acid content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a 
/major glycosylglycerolipid of leaf chloroplast membranes |CITS: [arabidopsis94]|.   
/
/C18:1 is desaturated from C18:0 in the form of stearoyl-ACP (|FRAME: PWY-5147|) and is subsequently 
/incorporated into glycerolipids. The rest of the unsaturated fatty acids, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:2 and 
/C18:3, on the other hand, are desaturated from C16:0 or C18:1 after C16:0 and C18:1 are incorporated 
/into glycerolipids. These latter desaturation processes are catalyzed by membrane-bound fatty acid 
/desaturases, and occur in chloroplasts and ER. Fatty acid desaturation is best studied in Arabidopsis 
/using desaturase mutants. 
/
/The desaturation of phosphatidylglycerol occurs in the chloroplast, and the desaturation of 
/phosphatidylcholine occurs in the ER. Note that desaturation occurs on both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains, 
/and that the order of the desaturation steps on one chain versus the other is not known. Here, all the 
/possible steps are presented.

TYPES - GIBBERELLINS-BIOSYNTHESIS
COMMON-NAME - gibberellin biosynthesis II (early C-3 hydroxylation)
CITATIONS - SUN08
CITATIONS - 2236013:EV-EXP:3341591195:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>  At the time of this review, 136 fully characterized gibberellins (starting with GA<sub>1</sub> |CITS:[5638147]|) have been identified in more than a hundred vascular plant species, seven bacteria and seven fungi |CITS:[SPONSEL04],[11986764]|.  Of these gibberellins only a few have biological activity.  Many of the GAs identified early in the history of the discovery of these hormones are the ones which possess the highest biological activity.  These include GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, GA<sub>5</sub>, GA<sub>6</sub> and GA<sub>7</sub>.  GA<sub>1</sub> is the most active GA for stem elongation in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Pisum sativum</i>, while GA<sub>4</sub> is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth.  In <i>Lolium</i>, GA<sub>5</sub> and GA<sub>6</sub> have been shown to enhance flowering, whilst GA<sub>1</sub> and GA<sub>4</sub> enhanced stem elongation |CITS:[12475622]|.
/
/Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate <i>via</i> the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).  They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME:C20SKELETON| and |FRAME:C19SKELETON|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C20SKELETON|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C19SKELETON|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.  C<sub>20</sub>-GAs do not usually have biological activity but can be metabolized to active C<sub>19</sub>-GAs (note that not all C<sub>19</sub>-GAs are bioactive).
/
/Gibberellins are believed to be synthesized in young tissues of the shoot and also the developing seed.  It is uncertain whether young root tissues also produce gibberellins.  There is also some evidence that leaves may be the source of some biosynthesis.
/
/Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant.  Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits.
/
/Certain commercial chemicals which are used to stunt growth do so in part because they block the synthesis of gibberellins.  Some of these chemicals are |FRAME:CPD-6966|, |FRAME:CPD-6967|, |FRAME:CPD-6968|, ancymidol and |FRAME:CPD-6970| (more inhibitors of GA biosynthesis can be found in |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|).  During active growth, the plant will maintain gibberellin homeostasis by metabolizing most gibberellins by rapid hydroxylation to inactive conjugates.  Active |FRAME:GIBBERELLIN| is degraded much slower which helps to explain the symptoms observed in the disease bakanae caused by the rice pathogen <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  This pathogen produces large amounts of GA<sub>3</sub> which it secretes.  Inactive conjugates might be stored or translocated via the phloem and xylem before their release (activation) at the proper time and in the proper tissue.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  GA<sub>12</sub>, the first true gibberellin is synthesized in plastids (see |FRAME:PWY-5034|).  It is then further oxidized in the cytosol to a wide range of gibberellins.  Depending on the sequence of hydroxylation at the 3&beta;- and 13-positions, parallel pathways branch from GA<sub>12</sub> to the C<sub>19</sub>-GAs, the number and prevalence of these branch pathways varying from species to species.  The presence of the early C3-hydroxylation branch pathway, a pathway originating from GA<sub>12</sub> and leading to the hydroxylated C<sub>19</sub> GA<sub>4</sub> <i>via</i> formation of GA<sub>14</sub> has been demonstrated in particular in the developing seedlings and endosperm of the pumpkin <i>Cucurbita maxima</i> |CITS:[6126862],[9286114]|.  It was also shown that GA<sub>15</sub> could be the subject of C3-hydroxylation, thereby linking the C-3 hydroxylation pathway to the pathway |FRAME:PWY-5070|.
/
/<b>Enzymes:</b>  The reactions of this pathway are catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.  The first enzyme, gibberellin 3&beta;-hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of the C-3 carbon of GA<sub>12</sub> or GA<sub>15</sub>.  These enzymes generally have  broad spectrum of substrates and do not therefore specifically catalyze the early C-3 hydroxylation but also the 3&beta;-hydroxylation reactions of late C-3 hydroxylation pathways.  (Note: one pumpkin enzyme encoded by GA3ox3, however, was shown to specifically catalyze the late C-3 hydroxylation of GA<sub>9</sub> to GA<sub>4</sub>).  Gibberellin 20-oxidase, catalyzes the removal of C-20, thereby forming the C<sub>19</sub>-skeleton in GA<sub>4</sub>.  This enzyme performs the sequential oxidation of C-20 to the alcohol and aldehyde, followed by the removal of the C atom through formation of the 4, 10-lactone ring.  The alcohol intermediates (GA<sub>15</sub> and GA<sub>37</sub>) must be in their open lactone form (free alcohol) to be catalyzed by the enzyme.  Those gibberellins are however extracted from plants in their closed &delta;-lactone form (|FRAME:CPD-6971| and |FRAME:CPD-6974|) which is no longer oxidized by GA20-oxidases.  Although it is not certain whether this form occurs naturally <i>in planta</i> or is an artifact of the extraction procedure, it is interesting to note that spinach cell-free extracts contain an enzyme able to catalyze the conversion of the &delta;-lactone form to some free alcohol forms |CITS:[WARD97]|.

/thymidylate and panthotenate. In plants folates are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and 
/chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|. The fluxes through C1 pathways mediated 
/by folates are especially high for methylated compounds such as the secondary metabolites lignin, alkaloids and
/betaines and for primary metabolites such as choline, pectine and chlorophyll |CITS: [11337394]|.
/
/Although the biosynthetic steps in microbial folate biosynthesis essentially mirror the plant variant several differences 
/are noteworthy. In contrast to the bacteria pathway (|FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) which predominantly takes place
/in the cytosol, the plant variant of tetrahydrofolate and formyl-tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis is split between three 
/subcellular compartments |CITS: [11960743]|. Several plant enzymes involved in the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis 
/differ from their microbial counterparts with regard to functionality, regulation and composition |CITS: [9190084]| 
/|CITS: [14745019]| |CITS: [15500462]|. Plants prefer the polyglutamylated forms of folates (compare |FRAME:PWY-2161|, 
/|FRAME: PWY-2161B-PMN|) since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084]| 
/|CITS: [Scott00]| and meets the high demands for folates as observed in plants |CITS: [11960743]|. In addition 
/the conjugated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments 
/|CITS: [1916088]|.
/
/<b>Special information</b>:  Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pPABA) 
/and glutamate moieties. In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pPABA 
/(synthesized in plastids) in mitochondria followed by subsequent glutamylation and reduction steps which may 
/take place in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743]|  |CITS: [11752472]|. The one-carbon units 
/are either attached to the N-5 of the pterin moietie, to the N-10 of the pPAPA moiety or are brigded in between
/those two (e.g. 5,10-methenyl or methylene-THF) |CITS: [Basset05]|. The different forms of folates are jointly 
/connected and easily convertible into each other through a tight network of reactions (|FRAME:PWY-2201|).
/
/Among the many folates 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) is the most enigmatic compound involved in 
/the folate biosynthesis. 5-CHO-THF is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in the 
/C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, 
/5-CHO-THF is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The 
/biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the 
/regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445]|
/|CITS: [12207015]|. 
/
/The complete set of folate enzymes is only present in mitochondria. However, the recent discovery that 
/folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each of them encoded by a 
/different gene in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least parts of the pathway 
/can be carried out independently in those compartments. Interestingly, the enzyme hydrolyzing the polyglutamylated 
/folates (gamma-glutamyl hydrolase) has been found to be an extracellular enzyme in plants |CITS: [8912628]|. 
/Consequently, the transport and exact conversion of folates and their derivatives within the different cell 
/compartments and their regulation pattern remains to be clarified before successfully attempting the endeavor 
/to genetically engineer this pathway.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Leucodelphinidin is a colorless intermediate in the biosynthesis of the corresponding colored anthocyanin delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and derivatives thereof (|FRAME:PWY-5153|) |CITS: [12828368][14719829]|. Leucoanthocyanidins in general are compounds at a branch-point embedded in that metabolic sequence and represent an important regulatory point to feed a range of flavonoid subclasses of diverse biological properties |CITS: [11402179]|.
/
/The occurrence of delphinidin-type pigments in the plant kingdom has been found widespread, namely in plant families such as <i>Gentianacea</i>, <i>Geraniacea</i>, |FRAME:TAX-4747| and <i>Solanacea</i> |CITS: [ANDERSEN06]|. 
/Special attention to explore the underlying pathways has been paid to the genus Petunia which is a widely-cultivated 
/flowering plant with a broad range of flower colors |CITS: [SINK84]| |CITS: [WIERING84]| |CITS: [15587706]|. Leucodelphinidin which has a trihydroxylated B-ring gives rise to anthocyanins adding blue colors to a broad variety of plants |CITS: [11287230]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The dihydroflavonol central to leucodelphinidin biosynthesis and the delphinidin derived anthocyanins is dihydromyricetin. The complete, trifold hydroxylation of the flavonoid B-ring to form dihydromyricetin can be catalyzed via various intermediates, such as dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquercetin and eriodictyol. 
/
/The most important enzyme involved in the B-ring hydroxylation is the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase |CITS: [8232589]| 
/|CITS: [10476065]| |CITS: [10567704]|. The enzyme may successively hydroxylate naringenin and dihydrokaempferol 
/at the 3' and 5'-position to form 5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanone and dihyromyricetin, respectively. However, 
/intermediate substrates already hydroxylated at the 3'-position such as dihydroquercetin and eriodictyol are also accepted by the enzyme for 5'-hydroxylation and may constitute a prerequisite for this step |CITS: [10476065]|. It has been demonstrated that a cytochrome b5, presumably involved in the regulation of the flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase activity is necessary for the full color development of 3',5'-hydroxylated pigments |CITS: [9892710]|. Other factors, namely copigments such as phenolic acids |CITS: [12452676]|, flavones and flavonols |CITS: [11164576]| are also involved in the stability and increase of color intensity.
/
/The flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase and the flavanone 3&beta;-hydroxylase are modifying enzymes of this pathway which either specifically hydroxylate the B-ring 3'-position |CITS: [10504566]| or catalyze the conversion of flavanones to dihydroflavonols |CITS: [Forkmann80]| |CITS: [2154946]|. Although experimental evidence on the conversion of pentahydroxyflavanone to dihydromyrcetin is still missing the reaction is believed to occur |CITS: [8232589]| |CITS: [10567704]| |CITS: [11287230]|.
/
/The discernible step in the biosynthetic route towards leucoanthocyanidins is the stereospecific reduction of (2R,3R)-dihydroflavonols carried out by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR). The enzyme generally exhibits a pronounced substrate specificity which determines a visible pattern of anthocyanins, catechins and proanthocyanidins indicative for certain species |CITS: [12435592]|. However, other species such as |FRAME:TAX-101596| possess DFR's that are able to use a broad varieties of substrates including the three dihydroflavonols |CITS: [3293532]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The 3',5'-methylated flavonol syringetin and its precursor myricetin has been 
/found throughout the plant kingdom (e.g. |CITS: [1367884]| |CITS: [10856635]| |CITS: [14690384]| |CITS: [15806302]| 
/but as for many other flavonoids the glycosylated derivatives occur more frequently than their aglycons 
/|CITS: [Wollenweber94]| |CITS: [ Williams94]|. 
/
/The occurrence of laricitrin, the 3'-monomethylated derivative of myricetin and direct precursor for syringetin 
/has been verified during metabolic profiling in plants |CITS: [17002441]|. That demonstrates the existence 
/of that compound (and its glucosides) on its own, indicating that laricitrin is not merely a transient intermediate 
/of the pathway as assumed earlier. The pharmaceutical importance for human health has been demonstrated for 
/many flavonols (for example |FRAME:PWY-5059|, |FRAME:PWY-5320|, |FRAME:PWY-5390|). Similar reports 
/exist with regard to myricetin and its methylated derivatives. The therapeutic potential of these compounds are 
/considerable, as antioxidants as well as their use as anti-inflammatory, antiartherosclerotic and antithrombotic 
/agents that have been revealed in related animal research (reviewed by |CITS: [9251891]|).  Moreover, myricetin 
/was found to reduce the danger of skin cancer, indicating its usefulness as an anticarcinogen |CITS: [3128399]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzymatic step(s) representing the entry towards the biosynthetic route 
/of syringetin are catalyzed by enzymes that form the intermediate dihydromyricetin. That is the first flavonol bearing 
/three hydroxyl groups on the flavonoid B-ring. Dihydromyricetin is the branch point flavonol that is central to both 
/the formation of syringetin and the biosynthesis of corresponding anthocyanins such as delphinidin 
/(see |FRAME:PWY-5153|) and derivatives thereof (e.g. petunidin, hirsutin, ternatin). The enzymes catalyzing 
/the formation of dihydromyrecetin are cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases that either introduce two 
/hydroxyl groups to dihydrokaempferol (flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylases)(e.g. |CITS: [10476065]|) or form that 
/compound using the successive interconnection of flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (e.g. |CITS: [10504566]|) and 
/flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (e.g. |CITS: [10567704]|) via dihydroquercetin.
/
/The 2-oxoglutarate dependent flavonol synthase catalyzing the formation of flavonols from dihydroflavonols 
/(EC 1.14.11.23) have been found in several plants |CITS: [16556978]| |CITS: [12620339]| |CITS: [12782296]| 
/however the specific conversion of dihyromyricetin to myricetin remains to be corroborated. 
/
/The final step in the pathway, the 3'- and 5'-<i>O</i>-methylation forming laricitrin and syringetin, respectively 
/is carried out by a unique <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (CrOMT2) that catalyzes two consecutive methylation 
/steps on the same substrate. It was demonstrated that dihydromyricetin was also a suitable substrate for 
/this enzyme. The methylation pattern corresponds to the glycosides and anthocyanins found in |FRAME:TAX-4058| 
/which supports the involvement of CrOMT2 in their biosynthesis |CITS: [12482447]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Flavonoids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Flavonoids are a highly diverse class of plant secondary metabolites (with about 9000 compounds identified so far |CITS: [16137727]|) derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Based on core structures and chemical modifications flavonoids are classified as chalcones, aurones, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones and anthocyanins. Flavonoids serve as pigments (red and purple anthocyanin pigments), act as signals for pollinators and other organisms, participate in plant hormone signaling, facilitate pollen-tube growth, protect plants from UV-B radiation, and function as phytoalexins |CITS: [11130659]|, |CITS: [10924197]|, |CITS: [11402179]|. 
/
/Flavone and flavonol-<i>O</i>-glycosides make up one of the largest classes of flavonoid constituents with over 2000 known structures. Although |FRAME:GLC| |CITS:[5058406]| and |FRAME:CPD0-1112| |CITS:[1939145]| are the most frequent <i>O</i>-glycoside conjugates found on flavones and flavonols, the presence of arabinose, xylose, and glucuronic acid has also been reported. The formation of |FRAME:CPD-14825| from |FRAME:LUTEOLIN-7-O-BETA-D-GLUCOSIDE| catalyzed by a flavonoid 1,6-glucosyltransferase isolated from cultured cells of |FRAME:TAX-4058| |CITS:[19561332]| |CITS:[17940060]| further extends the structural complexity of luteolin glycosides occurring in plants. 
/

COMMON-NAME - stearate biosynthesis II (bacteria and plants)
CITATIONS - Li10
CITATIONS - 18506098:EV-EXP:3444669081:peifenz
COMMENT - Stearate is a saturated fatty acid that occurs in many animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is an important 
/constituent of milk fats, lard, and cocoa and shea butters. Stearate was first described by Michel Eugene Chevreul 
/in 1823, and its name comes from Greek for "hard fat", reflecting the fact that stearate forms a waxy solid.
/
/In plants elongation to stearate appears to continue via [acp]-bound intermediates, and stearoyl-[acp] has been 
/detected in many species |CITS: [4831331]|. The elongation from palmitoyl-[acp] to stearoyl-[acp] is catalyzed by 
/KASII (beta-ketoacyl-[acp] synthase II).
/
/Stearoyl-[acp] can be hydrolyzed by acyl-ACP thioesterase enzymes, in which case the free fatty acids are 
/exported to the cytosol |CITS: [7734968]|. A second route involves acyl-ACP desaturase enzymes, which introduce a 
/double bond in the 9 position of stearoyl-[acp] to generate oleoyl-[acp] (see |FRAME: PWY-5147|). Since the activity of the 
/desaturase enzymes is often very high, oleate is often the main product of intraplastidial fatty acid 
/synthesis |CITS: [8652653]|. 
/
/The computational annotation and assignment of enzymes and genes to the pathway remain to be curated with literature information.

COMMENT - Many organisms can synthesize guanosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: GMP GMP| (GMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP inosine-5'-phosphate| (IMP) and |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE xanthosine-5-phosphate| (XMP) , which is converted to GMP by the action of |FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX GMP synthetase|, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate (see |FRAME: PWY-6125 guanosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis|). Note that the free base |FRAME: GUANINE guanine| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms also use salvage enzymes to obtain purine bases and nucleosides and convert them to the corresponding nucleotides. The pathway described here is used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms for this purpose.
/For example, all parasitic protozoa (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820 <i>Plasmodium</i>|, |FRAME: TAX-5810 <i>Toxoplasma</i>|, |FRAME: TAX-38568 <i>Leishmania</i>|, |FRAME: TAX-5690 <i>Trypanosoma</i>|) lack the ability to synthesize purine nucleotides <i>de novo</i>and use this salvage pathway to convert purine bases and nucleosides obtained from their hosts to the corresponding nucleotides |CITS: [3920982][6316234]|. After their uptake by specific transporters |CITS: [ 7443300][ 10743614]| the purine nucleosides are first hydrolyzed to ribose and a base by nucleoside hydrolases. The bases are then converted to the concomitant nucleotides by |FRAME: GPT-CPLX xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|, which utilizes |FRAME: PRPP 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate| to convert the free base to the mononucleotide |FRAME: GMP GMP|.
/Nucleoside hydrolases from parasites are attractive drug targets against parasitic protozoa since no such activity has been reported thus far in mammalian cells |CITS: [6396514]|.
/
/The pathway has also been described in green plants |CITS: [GURANOWSKI79]|.
/
/Other routes from |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| to |FRAME: GMP GMP| are described in |FRAME: PWY-6620 guanine and guanosine salvage I| and |FRAME: PWY-6618 guanine and guanosine salvage III|.

COMMENT - Methionine biosynthesis in plants differs from that in microorganisms. O-phospho-homoserine, instead of O-succinyl-homoserine, is the intermediate converting homoserine to cystathionine. Plants can utilize 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate, S-methylmethionine, and S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donors in converting homocysteine to methionine.

COMMENT - <b>General information:</b> Sinapoylesters (sinapoylmalate, sinapoylcholine) have been found predominantly in the 
/Brassicaceae family, where those esters are among the major soluble phenylpropanoid metabolites to be accumulated 
/|CITS: [8972602]|. While the function of sinapoylcholine as such is not yet elucidated, sinapoylmalate has been found 
/to act as an UV-B protectant in vegetative plant tissues |CITS: [11080303]|.
/
/It has been established that each of the sinapoyl esters are produced and utilized at different times in the course of 
/the plant's development.  During the germination of the seeds the formation of sinapoylglucose and sinapoylcholine 
/prevails, which is reflected by the fact that most crucifer seeds are especially rich of sinapoylcholine (sinapine) 
/|CITS: [8382030]|.  The sinapine esterase hydrolyzes sinapine producing sinapate and choline which has been proposed 
/to be needed for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (|FRAME:PWY-3561|) in the growing seedlings |CITS: [Strack81]|. 
/In this development stage the seedlings use the released sinapate to produce sinapoylmalate via the intermediate 
/sinapoylglucose |CITS: [8972602]| to increase UV-B tolerance. Sinapoylmalate is not produced under light limiting 
/conditions, implicating that a light factor may be required for the final assembly of the compound |CITS: [9880351]|. 
/This finding fits in the role and timed appearance of sinapoylmalate. Indeed , dark-grown seedlings contain considerably 
/less sinapoylmalate and accumulate another sinapate ester, 1,2-disinapoylglucose instead. This has been discussed as 
/a 'disproportionation' reaction to channel 1-sinapoylglucose towards diverse metabolic products in response to 
/developmental circumstances |CITS: [Strack84]|.
/
/It has been shown that the biosynthesis and deposition of sinapate esters takes place in the vacuole, whereas the 
/energy rich compound sinapoylglucose is probably formed in the cytosol |CITS: [Strack85]|. Sinapoylmalate has also 
/been found to be accumulated in the adaxial surface of the leaves, suggesting the possibility of a transportation step 
/between biosynthesis and accumulation of sinapate esters |CITS: [9880351]|.
/
/<b>Special information:</b> The sinapate ester pathway is governed by five enzymes, which appear to be transcriptional 
/regulated in response to seed and seedling development. It has been proposed that the transcriptional control of the 
/glucosyltransferase and sinapoyltransferases link sinapate to the sinapate ester pathway in a coordinated manner 
/|CITS: [15053762]|. However, how the sinapate ester pathway is actually regulated is still a matter of debate. Based on 
/results with a mutant line of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with enhanced expression of the gene encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase 
/(C4H) coinciding with a increased production of sinapate esters, the C4H was proposed to be the rate-limiting step of this pathway 
/|CITS: [11080161]|. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the phenylpropanoid acid biosynthetic sequence leading to 
/sinapic acid, the direct precursor for the sinapate esters. This sequence is also involved in the biosynthesis of syringyl 
/lignin, where the ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H) catalyzing the final step to sinapate, is considered as a rate-limiting step 
/|CITS: [0009618461]|. Consequently, this enzyme was proposed to be regulatory for the sinapate ester biosynthesis as 
/well. However, Ruegger and coworkers |CITS: [9880351]| could demonstrate that, while F5H is regulatory involved in 
/the making of syringyl lignin its role in sinapate ester biosynthesis is different. The results of this work point out either a 
/more upstream transcriptional regulation excluding the phenylpropanoid acid pathway or a regulation which may be 
/posttranscriptional in nature.  
/
/Sinapoylesters are considered as antinutritive compounds |CITS: [Naczk98]|, contributing to bitter taste, forming complexes 
/with proteins during oil refining, and overall diminishing the value of seeds for human purposes. Special attention within this 
/area is given to the prime model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, where the pathway has already been investigated 
/on the molecular level |CITS: [15053762]|.

COMMENT - S-methylmethionine (SMM) is synthesized from methionine by methionine S-methyltransferase (MMT), 
/a unique enzyme to plants. SMM has been hypothesized to be an essential methyl donor or transport 
/form of sulfur. These remain to be tested. The SMM cycle has been hypothesized to rectify overshoots in 
/the conversion of free methionine required for protein biosynthesis to adenosylmethionine in the 
/SAM cycle (|FRAME: PWY-5041|) by providing a way to convert the methionine moiety locked up in 
/adenosylmethionine back to free methionine. Alternatively, the SMM cycle has been hypothesized to 
/regulate the cellular adenosylmethionine level hence the methylation ratio. Characterization of an 
/Arabidopsis MMT knock-out mutant, which has a significant higher level of adenosylmethionine content 
/and unaltered free methionine pool, indicates the SMM cycle contributes to regulation of cellular 
/methylation ratio rather than preventing depletion of free methionine. 
/
/SMM cycle operates through out the plant, and consumes one-half of the adenosylmethionine 
/produced in the Arabidopsis leaves.

COMMENT - Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a prevalent form of auxin, is an important phytohormone that affects many aspects of plant
/development throughout the whole plant life cycle. IAA also plays a crucial role in allowing plants to respond to the biotic and
/abiotic stimuli they encounter |CITS: [15749753]|. IAA is subject to a number of biochemical modifications that regulate its
/activity and allow plants to fine tune their levels of active auxin |CITS: [15749753]|.
/
/IAA can be conjugated to a number of amino acids through the activity of enzymes with structural similarity to the
/firefly luciferase family of adenylate forming enzymes |CITS: [15659623]|. Some of these amino acid modifications can be
/reversed through the activity of amido hydrolases |CITS:[7792259][10072397]|, suggesting that some compounds,
/such as IAA-alanine and IAA-leucine, are storage forms of auxin that can be metabolized
/to contribute to the pool of free auxin |CITS: [15659623]|. Other IAA-amino acid conjugates, such as IAA-aspartate,
/are targeted for further breakdown (|CITS:[9733548]| (see |FRAME:PWY-2021|) and act as intermediates in IAA catabolic
/pathways. 
/
/Given the importance of auxin homeostatic maintenance, the transcripts encoding several IAA-amido synthetases are
/up-regulated in response to applications of free auxin (rev in |CITS:[15659623]|). 
/
/Together with an array of other IAA-based modification pathways (see |FRAME:PWY-1782|),
/IAA-amino acid conjugation appears to play a vital role in regulating the active levels of a potent phytohormone.

COMMENT - Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that plays important roles in many aspects of metabolism. In plants, 
/like in animals, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA feeds into the TCA cycle for the generation of energy and 
/reducing power. In the plastid, acetyl-CoA serves as a substrate for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. In 
/the plant cell cytosol, acetyl-CoA, its derivative malonyl-CoA to be precise, is a precursor for the 
/synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and many secondary metabolites including flavonoids and terpenoids. 
/The distinct pools of acetyl-CoA are generated via different biosynthetic routes in plants.  
/The mitochondrial and plastid acetyl-CoA pools are derived from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase 
/complex (see pathway |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|), whereas, the cytosolic pool is derived from 
/citrate and ATP, catalyzed by ATP-citrate lyase. 
/
/Besides plants, the pathway for acetyl-CoA biosynthesis from cirate, illustrated here, also occurs in vertebrates. 
/In vertebrates, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol genesis are cytosolic processes. The 
/acetyl-CoA synthesized from citrate in the cytosol feeds into these processes.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The conversion of formate to CO<sub>2</sub> is the terminal enzymatic step in the metabolic conversion
/of C1 compounds to CO<sub>2</sub>. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) activity has been detected in most
/methylotrophs, and several FDHs have been purified.
/Many organisms contain multiple FDHs. For example, |FRAME: TAX-272630| possesses three different FDHs.
/None of these is essential for growth on methanol, since formate can also be used for biosynthesis in this organism,
/through the reversible tetrahydrofolate pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-1722|).
/However, a triple mutant, lacking any FDH activity, is not able to grow on formate, confirming that formate oxidation
/to CO<sub>2</sub> is the necessary energy-generating step during growth on formate |CITS: [14679220]|.
/
/* an |FRAME: CPLX-1241| also exists (EC 1.2.1.43). It is not found in methylotrophs, and usually catalyzes the
/reaction in the opposite direction, forming formate from CO<sub>2</sub>.

TYPES - Ammonia-Assimilation
COMMON-NAME - ammonia assimilation cycle I
CITATIONS - 14757761:EV-EXP:3579440776:dreher
COMMENT - The primary nitrogen assimilation routes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and prokaryotes are nitrogen fixation, nitrate assimilation, and ammonia assimilation.
/Ammonia is liberated by photorespiration, protein and amino acid metabolism, and the breakdown of nitrogen transport compounds. The rate of ammonia generation during photorespiration is about 10 times the rate of nitrate assimilation.
/
/The ammonia released from photorespiration is immediately re-assimilated via the ammonia assimilation cycle. The net result of this cycle is the conversion of one molecule of ammonia to one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one ATP molecule.
/
/The pathway includes two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-4585 "glutamine synthetase"| (GS) and |FRAME: MONOMER-7421 "glutamate synthase"| (also known as <b>g</b>lutamine <b>o</b>xo<b>g</b>lutarate <b>a</b>mino<b>t</b>ansferase or GOGAT), and thus is often referred to as the GS/GOGAT pathway. Two types of GOGAT are known in photosynthetic organisms - NADH-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent. NADH-GOGAT is found in the nucleus of vascular plants, fungi, and diatoms. The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is only found in Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PWY-6964|). 
/
/An NADPH-dependent version of GOGAT is found in non-photosynthetic bacteria and archaea (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Pyrimidine nucleotide are essential compounds required in a plethora of 
/metabolic events that ensure normal growth, development and reproduction of plants |CITS: [16669783]| 
/|CITS: [Moffatt02]|. As true for the nucleotides fabricated in the |FRAME:PWY-841| pyrimidines are produced 
/in a energy consuming biosynthetic pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-5686|), hence plants have developed ways 
/to recycle nucleosides and components in metabolic low-cost pathways such as in the pyrimidine salvage 
/pathway (this pathway). 
/
/It appears that a tight correlation exists in plants which connects pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis and salvage 
/pathway in a coordinately regulated manner |CITS: [15820655]|. When cells are at rest the demand for 
/nucleotides can be generally satisfied by reusing preformed nucleosides and bases through the corresponding 
/salvage pathways. It has also been reported that in time of high requisition such as germination, pollen tube 
/growth, flowering, and seed set the salvage pathway appears to be the preferred source for nucleotide production 
/during the first few hours which only later on switches over to the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides 
/|CITS: [ASHIHARA77]| |CITS: [14977572]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) is the end product of the <i>de novo</i> 
/biosynthesis. UMP can be recycled via two compounds involved in pyrimidine metabolism, i.e. the base 
/uracil and the nucleoside uridine. Uracil is the only base that can be directly reused whereas pyrimidine 
/nucleosides such as uridine and cytidine are restored to their corresponding nucleotides UMP and CMP, 
/respectively |CITS: [9490773]| |CITS: [KANAMORIFUKUDA81]|. 
/
/The only enzyme that has been functionally characterized in the Arabidopsis pathway is the bi-functional 
/uridine kinase/ uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (AtUK/UPRT1). The uridine kinase activity was found in the 
/N-terminal region of the gene whereas the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity was located in the C-terminal 
/region. The molecular function of UK, i.e. catalyzing the formation of uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) from 
/uridine and adenine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and UPRT, i.e. catalyzing the formation of UMP from uracil and 
/phosphoribosyl-&alpha;-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), respectively was confirmed in mutants and double mutants 
/of <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [17143579]|. It has been shown that certain enzymes involved in salvage pathways 
/e.g. uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) exist in small gene families in plants with the isoforms being 
/differentially expressed either in the cytosol or plastids |CITS: [15806101]| |CITS: [14593172]|.
/
/The two other enzymes of the Arabidopsis pyrimidine salvage pathway, i.e. the pyrimidin specific 5'-nucleotidase 
/(EC 3.1.3.5) and the uridine nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.3) have not yet been cloned and remain to be characterized.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The formation of alanine, one of the most abundant amino acids in plants can be synthesized in plants via two pathways; the formation of alanine from pyruvate (see |FRAME:ALANINE-SYN2-PWY|) and the usage of L-cysteine as a substrate to produce L-alanine and elemental sulfur (this pathway). The enzyme catalyzing the latter, i.e. cysteine desulfurases are essential enzymes which have been found to be required in all living organisms for the synthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters (for review see |CITS:[15951221]|). 
/
/Beside the formation of those Fe-S clusters the cysteine desulfurases are involved in a number of more unspecific functions through their sulfur transferase activity. Most notably is their involvement in the |FRAME: PWY-5354-ARA| and |FRAME:THISYN-PWY| which constitute cofactors essential for numerous reactions in plants (e.g. |CITS:[11578927]| as well as their participation in photosynthetic processes |CITS: [RAVEN99]|
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> contains two cysteine desulfurases located in mitochondria and chloroplasts. The plastidic cysteine desulfurase, i.e. NFS2 (AT1G08490) has been investigated in some detail revealing the involvement of the enzyme in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis and/or Selenium metabolism |CITS:[12033984]| |CITS:[12427997]|. The mitochondrial form of cysteine desulfurase, i.e. NFS1 (AT5G65720) has been discussed as a proof for the existence of a conserved Fe/S-cluster biosynthesis in mitochondria which is probably linked to intracellular iron homeostasis |CITS:[11158531]|.
/
/Proteins involved in the sulfur (SUF) protein-mediated Fe-S cluster biogenesis such as AtSufE have been shown to induce both the mitochondrial and the plastidic form of cysteine desulfursase |CITS:[16437155]|. Silencing of the plastidic cysteine desulfurase did not influence the mitochondrial form corroborating the finding that mitochondria and chloroplasts have separate, crucial cysteine desulfurases and Fe-S cluster assembly mechanisms |CITS:[17372218]|.

COMMON-NAME - gibberellin biosynthesis III (early C-13 hydroxylation)
CITATIONS - SUN08
CITATIONS - sponsel04:EV-EXP:3341586864:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>  At the time of this review, 136 fully characterized gibberellins (starting with GA<sub>1</sub> |CITS:[5638147]|) have been identified in more than a hundred vascular plant species, seven bacteria and seven fungi |CITS:[SPONSEL04],[11986764]|.  Of these gibberellins only a few have biological activity.  Many of the GAs identified early in the history of the discovery of these hormones are the ones which possess the highest biological activity.  These include GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, GA<sub>5</sub>, GA<sub>6</sub> and GA<sub>7</sub>.  GA<sub>1</sub> is the most active GA for stem elongation in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Pisum sativum</i>, while GA<sub>4</sub> is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth.  In <i>Lolium</i>, GA<sub>5</sub> and GA<sub>6</sub> have been shown to enhance flowering, whilst GA<sub>1</sub> and GA<sub>4</sub> enhanced stem elongation |CITS:[12475622]|.
/
/Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate <i>via</i> the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).  They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME:C20SKELETON| and |FRAME:C19SKELETON|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C20SKELETON|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C19SKELETON|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.  C<sub>20</sub>-GAs do not usually have biological activity but can be metabolized to active C<sub>19</sub>-GAs (note that not all C<sub>19</sub>-GAs are bioactive).
/
/Gibberellins are believed to be synthesized in young tissues of the shoot and also the developing seed.  It is uncertain whether young root tissues also produce gibberellins.  There is also some evidence that leaves may be the source of some biosynthesis.
/
/Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant.  Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits.
/
/Certain commercial chemicals which are used to stunt growth do so in part because they block the synthesis of gibberellins.  Some of these chemicals are |FRAME:CPD-6966|, |FRAME:CPD-6967|, |FRAME:CPD-6968|, ancymidol and |FRAME:CPD-6970| (more inhibitors of GA biosynthesis can be found in |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|).  During active growth, the plant will maintain gibberellin homeostasis by metabolizing most gibberellins by rapid hydroxylation to inactive conjugates.  Active |FRAME:GIBBERELLIN| is degraded much slower which helps to explain the symptoms observed in the disease bakanae caused by the rice pathogen <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  This pathogen produces large amounts of GA<sub>3</sub> which it secretes.  Inactive conjugates might be stored or translocated via the phloem and xylem before their release (activation) at the proper time and in the proper tissue.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  GA<sub>12</sub>, the first true gibberellin is synthesized in plastids (see |FRAME:PWY-5034|).  It is then further oxidized in the cytosol to a wide range of gibberellins.  Depending on the sequence of hydroxylation at the 3&beta;- and 13-positions, parallel pathways branch from GA<sub>12</sub> to the C<sub>19</sub>-GAs, the number and prevalence of these branch pathways varying from species to species.  The presence of the early 13-hydroxylation branch pathway, a pathway originating from GA<sub>12</sub> <i>via</i> GA<sub>53</sub> and leading to the hydroxylated C<sub>19</sub> GA<sub>1</sub> has been demonstrated in many species including maize, rice, pea and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[10557253],[11117879],[9154988],[7630935]|.
/
/<b>Enzymes:</b>  The reactions of this pathway are catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.  The first step of this pathway is performed by a gibberellin 13-hydroxylase which to date has not been identified in any of the plant species studied.  This elusive enzyme allows for the conversion of GA<sub>12</sub> to GA<sub>53</sub>.  The following enzyme of this pathway, gibberellin 20-oxidase, catalyzes the removal of C-20, thereby forming the C<sub>19</sub>-skeleton in GA<sub>20</sub>.  This enzyme performs the sequential oxidation of C-20 to the alcohol and aldehyde, followed by the removal of the C atom through formation of the 4, 10-lactone ring.  The alcohol intermediate (GA<sub>44</sub>) must be in its open lactone form (free alcohol) to be catalyzed by the enzyme.  It is however extracted from plants in its closed &delta;-lactone form (|FRAME:GIBBERELLIN-44|) which is no longer oxidized by GA20-oxidases.  Although it is not certain whether this form occurs naturally <i>in planta</i> or is an artifact of the extraction procedure, it is interesting to note that spinach cell-free extracts contain an enzyme able to catalyze the conversion of the &delta;-lactone form to its free alcohol form |CITS:[WARD97]|.  Additional oxidation reactions leading t the formation of growth-active GAs such as GA<sub>1</sub> are performed by gibberellin 3-oxidases which, depending on the species, are varyingly regiospecific |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|.

COMMENT - Acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS) are important in intracellular movements of fatty acids. Intracellular 
/membranes are generally barriers of acyl-CoAs, thus fatty acid transport involves the generation of 
/free fatty acids and subsequent activation to acyl-CoAs after crossing the membrane. Acyl-CoAs 
/are substrates for the biosynthesis of seed storage lipids, membrane lipids, wax, cutin and suberin. 
/In plant cells, ACS activity has been detected in plastids, oil bodies, peroxisomes, mitochondria, 
/and the ER. 
/  
/The Arabidopsis genome has nine functional genes encoding acyl-CoA synthetase|CITS: [12177484]|. 
/Genetic and biochemical evidence have sorted physiological roles for some of them. The plastidial 
/LACS9 contributes to the activation of de novo synthesized fatty acids during their exporting from 
/the chloroplast|CITS: [12177483]|. LACS6 and LACS7 are peroxisome-localized and are involved in fatty 
/acids beta-oxidation (|FRAME: PWY-5136|) in the peroxisome|CITS: [12366803]|. LACS2 is required for cutin 
/biosynthesis (|FRAME: PWY-321|). LACS2 was shown to activate the cutin monomer 
/16-hydroxypalmitate|CITS: [14973169]|. The resulted 16-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA is a substrate for the 
/second hydroxylation to yield another cutin monomer 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate.

COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>
/
/Until recently, the existence of |FRAME:TREHALOSE| (a disaccharide widespread among microorganisms and invertebrates and involved in stress protection, particularly with regard to desiccation, freezing, and heat stress), in vascular plants was under debate. However, trehalose has since been shown to be present in <i>Arabidopsis</i> |CITS:[11161063],[11520870]|.
/
/Trehalase, the enzyme activity that hydrolyses |FRAME:TREHALOSE|, is present in all organs of higher plants, with the highest activities in flowers. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, trehalase activity is present in multiple tissues and it is particularly high in flowers |CITS:[11161063]|.  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the formation of Clubroot, a disease characterized by stunted growth and by gall formation in the root system of infected plants, resulted in a strong increase in trehalase activity in the roots (including the hypocotyls) |CITS:[12118885]|.

COMMENT - Not much was known about alanine metabolism in plants until fairly recently. It has been shown that alanine is produced in large amounts and becomes one of the most abundant amino acids in plant roots under hypoxic conditions, and that alanine concentration decreases after the plants were returned to normal oxygen conditions. It is hypothesized that during hypoxia, alanine production maybe an effective mechanism used by plants to conserve nitrogen and carbon atoms that otherwise would be lost by anaerobic fermentation. Upon return to normal oxygen conditions, alanine degradation releases the stored nitrogen and carbon pools.   
/
/alanine:oxoglutarate aminotransferase (AOAT) catalyzes a reversible reaction that is involved in both biosynthesis and degradation of alanine. The Arabidopsis genome has a gene family of four AOAT genes. Two of them, AOAT1 and AOAT2 (GGAT1 and GGAT2, respectively) were shown, by in vitro assay using recombinant proteins, have four aminotransferase activities, namely glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase, glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase and AOAT. The two recombinant proteins exhibited very similar Km values towards amino acid substrates glutamate and alanine, as well as the oxoacid substrates glyoxylate, pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate. Among the four enzyme activities, glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase and alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase activities were most drastically reduced in the AOAT1 knock-out plants indicating AOAT1 is primarily involved in photorespiration. In agreement with this, the enzyme is located in peroxisomes. 
/
/AOAT3 (AlaAT2) is predicted located in the mitochondrion. AOAT4 (AlaAT1) is located in the cytosol. Expression of these genes is induced under hypoxic conditions. Comparison of the AOAT4 knock-out mutants with wild type plants for alanine concentration changes over hypoxic stress and the subsequent recovery indicated that AOAT4 is primarily involved in alanine breakdown during recovery from low oxygen stress. Alanine biosynthesis under hypoxia does not require AOAT4 activity.
/
/The in vivo role of AOAT2 and AOAT3 is not clear. And it is not clear which AOAT contributes to alanine biosynthesis.

COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>  The conversion of <i>ent</i>-kaurene into GA<sub>12</sub> is the second step in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway.  In higher plants, this process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum.  This conversion requires six oxidation steps performed by two multifunctional enzymes: <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase, a membrane-associated cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and <i>ent</i>-kaurenoic acid oxidase another P450 |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|.  The former catalyzes the sequential oxidation of the C-19 methyl group of <i>ent</i>-kaurene <i>via</i> the alcohol and the aldehyde to the carboxylic acid <i>ent</i>-kaurenoic acid; the latter catalyzes the triple oxidation of <i>ent</i>-kaurenoic acid first on C-7, then on C-6 (this step involves the contraction of ring B from six C atoms to five, thereby transforming the <i>ent</i>-kaurane carbon skeleton to the <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure) and C-7 again to form GA<sub>12</sub>.  GA<sub>12</sub> is a branch point gibberellin in higher plants, further undergoing various oxidations and cyclizations to form the whole spectrum of gibberellins.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 "thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21)"| (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 "deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74)"|.
/This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria |CITS: [402352]|, mammals |CITS: [7494863]|, and plants |CITS: [22897443]|.
/
/Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans |FRAME: CPLX-8618| is encoded by the |FRAME: HS08100| gene, while two isozymes, encoded by |FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, catalyze thymidine kinase activity |CITS: [6281270][8380161]|.
/
/|FRAME: TAX-3702| posseses two thymidine kinase genes (|FRAME: AT3G07800| and |FRAME: AT5G23070|), and a broad substrate range |FRAME: AT1G72040-MONOMER| encoded by a single |FRAME: AT1G72040| gene that can phosphorylate both |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| |CITS: [22897443]|.
/
/Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-90370|, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine |CITS: [EcoSal]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.
/
/In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE|, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to dTMP by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)"|.

COMMENT - Triacyglycerols (TAG) from vegetable oils are a major source of essential fatty acids in human diet, namely polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) linoleate (18:2) and linolenate (18:3). In oilseeds, TAG is synthesized via the |FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY "Kennedy pathway"|, where the precursor diacylglycerol (DAG) is de novo synthesized from glycerol-3-phosphate. In addition to the Kennedy pathway, there are several other paths supplying DAG for TAG biosynthesis during seed development in plants |CITS: [19329563]|. Since further desaturation of 18:1 to form 18:2 and 18:3 occurs mainly in phosphatidylcholine (PC, see |FRAME: PWY-762 phospholipid desaturation|), together, these alternative paths in converting PC to DAG can provide enrichment of the PUFA content in TAG. 
/
/1) reverse reaction of CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT, 2.7.8.2)
/
/Radio tracer studies using microsomes isolated from developing safflower cotyledons indicated that CPT catalyzes a reversible exchange of diacylglycerol moieties between pools of PC and DAG |CITS: [Slack85]|. The maximum activity of CPT coincides with the maximum rate of accumulation of PC and TAG. It is very plausible that the releasing of PUFA-contained DAG from PC, catalyzed by the reverse activity of CPT, may contribute to the enrichment of PUFA in TAG.  
/
/2) phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase
/
/A novel enzyme was recently isolated from Arabidopsis |CITS: [19833868]|. The Arabidopsis phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase, encoded by ROD1, catalyzes the transfer of phosphocholine head group from PC to DAG. The interconversion of PC and DAG catalyzed by ROD1 provides a major route through which 18:1 (in DAG) enters PC for further desaturation, and in turn the PUFAs 18:2 and 18:3 (in PC) re-enter to the DAG pool for TAG biosynthesis. Arabidopsis ROD1 mutants had a 40% reduction of 18:2 and 18:3 in the seed TAG.  
/
/It was postulated that a phospholipase C (3.1.4.3) activity may also generate DAG for TAG synthesis. However no such activity has been reported in developing seeds |CITS: [19329563]|.  
/
/Besides the paths depicted here, an |FRAME: PWY-6803 "acyl editing mechanism"| also exists that can further enrich PUFA in oilseed TAG |CITS: [19329563]|.

COMMENT - Brassinosteroids (BR) are growth-promoting plant hormones. Brassinolide is the most active BR, whereas 26-hydroxybrassinolide is an inactive hormone |CITS: [14605216]|. Two CYP450s have been identified in Arabidopsis to inactivate BR, however via different biochemical mechanisms. CYP734A1 (previously called CYP72B1) was shown, biochemically and genetically, to be a C-26 hydroxylase that inactivates BR by converting brassinolide and castasteron to 26-hydroxybrassinolide and 26-hydroxycastasterone, respectively |CITS: [14605216]|. CYP72C1 is a homolog of CYP734A1. Although metabolite analysis of CYP72C1 over-expression mutant indicated that brassinolide, castasterone, 6-deoxocastasterone, 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone, 6-deoxotyphasterol and typhasterol are all potential substrates of CYP72C1, no corresponding C-26 hydroxylation products was found |CITS: [15773851]|. The mode of action for CYP72C1 is unclear.
/
/In addition to 26-hydroxylation, BR may be inactivated by 23-O-glucosulation. Over-expression of the Arabidopsis UDP-glucosyltransferase UGT73C5 in Arabidopsis plants led to BR-deficient phenotypes. Feeding the UGT73C5-overexpressing plants with castasterone (CS) and brassinolide (BL) caused a two orders of magnitude increase of 23-O-glucosides of CS and BL. The results suggested a role of glucosylation by UGT73C5 in BR homeostasis |CITS: [16214889]|. 
/
/A brassinosteroid sulfotransferase activity was also found in Arabidopsis which indicating another possible route of BR-inactivation |CITS: [17039368]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Glycolate as an intermediate of the |FRAME:PWY-181| pathway as well as glyoxylate an compound involved in the |FRAME:GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS| are compounds that can branch off from those pathways. Both compounds are recycled as carbon and energy source in the glycolate and glyoxylate degradation (this pathway) which channels the metabolism towards the |FRAME:PWY-5690|, the central component of carbohydrate metabolism.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The two reactions of this pathway are embedded in other pathways as well (see |FRAME:PWY-181|, |FRAME:GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|). The first step is catalyzed by glycolate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that oxidizes glycolate and forms glyoxylate. It has not been ruled out that the enzyme might be involved in other catalytic activities <i>in vivo</i> as well |CITS: [14966218]|. The second step is carried out by malate synthase, one of the key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle. The enzyme has been identified in Arabidopsis and shown to be partially dispensable for lipid utilization and gluconeogenesis in Arabidopsis seedlings |CITS:[15272001]|. Usually the enzyme participates in storage lipid mobilization in germinating seeds and seedlings of higher plants by catalyzing the condensation of glyoxylate and acetyl coenzyme A to form malate |CITS:[2914930]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| is a  non-standard amino acid that is not normally incorporated into proteins
/during protein synthesis.
/The name citrulline was coined in 1930 from |FRAME:TAX-3653|, the Latin name of the watermelon, from which it was
/first isolated.
/Free citrulline is formed mainly by catabolism of amino acids in the small intestine (see
/|FRAME:CITRULBIO-PWY|), as an intermediate in the conversion of ammonia to urea in the
/|FRAME:PWY-4984|, and as a by-product during the production of nitric oxide (see
/|FRAME:PWY-4983|).
/In addition, citrulline is also formed by modification of arginine residues in proteins (see
/|FRAME: PWY-4921|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Most of the citrulline circulating in the blood of mammals comes from glutamine conversion in
/enterocytes, the intetsinal absorptive cells found in the mucosa of the small intestine.
/Several other amino acids can also act as citrulline precursors, including glutamate, proline, and arginine.
/In rats, 28% of these metabolized amino acids are converted into citrulline.
/Two glutamate molecules are required for the synthesis of each citrulline molecule, only one of which
/can be substituted by another amino acid.
/
/The citrulline that is formed in the intestinal mucosa enters the blood stream, and reaches the kidneys,
/where it is coverted into arginine (see |FRAME:PWY-5004|). In adults, this citrulline to arginine
/conversion provides the body's full arginine requirements |CITS:[16082501]|. About 83% of the citrulline
/released from the intestine is metabolized by the kidneys |CITS:[7325229]|, and the rest is used for
/nitric acid production within other tissues.
/
/In new born mammals, which have a much larger need for arginine, proline is the main source of
/citrulline synthesis in the gut |CITS:[10329997]|. In addition, in new borns conversion of citrulline to
/arginine is not limited to the kidneys, and occurs in the intestinal mucosa as well.
/
/Inhibition of intestinal citrulline synthesis causes severe growth retardation |CITS:[4083357]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Lignans are a group of dimeric and/or oligomeric plant natural compounds of 
/phenylpropanoid origin. They represent a structurally highly diverse compound class that is characterized by 
/a 8,8'-linkage found in the C6-C3 dimers of coniferyl alcohol or other cinnamoyl alcohols although other interunit 
/linkages (e.g. 8-5', 8-O-4) may also occur |CITS: [Lewis99]| |CITS: [FUSS03]|. 
/
/Lignans and lignins are biosynthesized in two major branches which descend from the phenylpropanoid pathway. 
/During the conquest of land this pathway has been substantially advanced with consequences for derivative 
/biosyntheses such as for lignins/lignans, hydrolyzable and condensed tannins and flavonoids |CITS: [STAFFORD00]|. 
/Lignans are widespread among the plant kingdom but have not been found in aquatic plants such as algae 
/indicating their crucial contribution to adaptation and fitness of terrestrial plants |CITS: [AYRES90]| 
/|CITS: [11423139]|. The structural biopolymers lignins and lignans accomplish different tasks in plants, 
/lignins are involved in structural support and lignans have been attributed to protection and defense as their 
/primary physiological functions. Taken together lignins and lignans count for about 30% of carbon in vascular 
/plants |CITS: [Lewis99]|. 
/
/Beside their recognized functions as defense compounds in plants some lignans have attracted the attention 
/of scientists because of their application in medicine and human health |CITS: [MACRAE84]|. Lignans possess 
/most effective health protective and curative properties and have been employed as antioxidants |CITS: [14995053]|, 
/anti-carcinogenic agents |CITS: [10800470]| |CITS: [16311631]| and phytoestrogens |CITS: [15377220]|.
/
/Lignans can be subdivided into several structural subfamilies. The matairesinol pathway is an excellent example 
/for a pathway that not only contains several types of lignans but also gives rise to other lignan subfamilies. 
/(+)-pinoresinol (a furofuran) is sequentially converted to (+)-lariciresinol (a benzylaryltetrahydrofuran), 
/(-)-secoisolariciresinol (a dibenzylbutane) and (-)-matairesinol (a dibenzylbutyrolactone) which is an intermediate 
/in the biosynthetic route towards podophyllotoxin (an aryltetrahydronaphthalene) (compare |FRAME:PWY-5479|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Most lignans are optically active which results from the stereo-specific linkage 
/that builds the various dimers. The unique protein that mediates the regio- and stereospecificity of bimolecular 
/phenoxy radical coupling to generate oligomeric lignans and polymeric lignins has been identified and characterized 
/|CITS: [8994027]|. It could be demonstrated that this protein forms a multigene family in plants |CITS: [12359517]| 
/which are not limited to the formation of lignans but has been found to be involved in other biosyntheses of various 
/phenolics employing corresponding radicals. The protein named 'dirigent protein' (DP) does not express any 
/catalytic activity and serves only to bind and orientate the coniferyl alcohol-derived free radicals |CITS: [10859176]| 
/|CITS: [16023845]|. The first step of the biosynthesis therefore includes two proteins, one enzyme which may be 
/a unspecific oxidase and/or laccase and the dirigent protein mediating the radical-radical coupling with two coniferyl 
/alcohol radical substrates |CITS: [12135368]| |CITS: [14992596]|.
/
/Two distinct enzyme classes of (+)-pinoresinol/(+)-lariciresinol reductase (PLR) have been identified that 
/catalyze the second step in the matairesinol biosynthesis. Those enzymes are bifunctional and catalyze the 
/enantioselective reduction of (+)-pinoresinol and (+)-lariciresinol towards (-)-secoisolaricinol as discovered in 
/Forsythia |CITS: [8910615]| - left branch of the pathway- or engenders the formation of the opposite enantiomer 
/(+)-secoisolariciresinol from (-)-pinoresinol and (-)-lariciresinol intermediates as demonstrated in western 
/red cedar |CITS: [9872995]| - right branch of the pathway. Those enantiospecific enzymes have also been found 
/in different species of the same genus |CITS: [15949826]|.
/
/Another bifunctional enzyme, i.e. (-)-secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SDH) affords the formation of 
/(-)-matairesinol |CITS: [2037574]| via the stable intermediate (-)-lactol |CITS: [11278426]|. The reaction 
/mechanism was investigated in detail by means of the crystallized protein and it was shown that a catalytic 
/triad with a strictly conserved tyrosine residue |CITS: [15653677]| was essential for catalytic activity 
/|CITS: [16493463]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The |FRAME: PWY-5686 "<i>de novo</i> pathway of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis"| produces only the uridine ribonucleotide |FRAME: UMP|. All other ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides have to be derived from that nucleotide.
/Neither |FRAME:UMP| nor |FRAME:UDP| can be directly converted to |FRAME:CMP| or |FRAME:CDP|, respectively. The only uridine-based nucleotide that can be converted to a cytidine-based nucleotide is the triphosphate form |FRAME:UTP|. Thus the conversion of uridine-based nucleotides to cytidine-based nucleotides involves the phosphorylation of the <i>de novo</i>-synthesized UMP to UTP and its conversion to CTP (see |FRAME: PWY-7176|).
/Since the mono- and diphosphate forms are essential for protein and lipid glycosylation reactions (for example, in compounds such as |FRAME: CPD-606| and |FRAME: CMP-KDO|), nucleotide triphosphates need to be dephosphorylated to the mono- and diphosphate forms.
/
/There are many enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and amination of pyrimidine nucleotides, and these enzymes are often restricted to specific taxonomic groups. Thus, several pathway variants exist in MetaCyc to describe these transformations.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway is predicted to occur only in eukaryotes and thermophilic bacteria and archaea, since one of its key enzymes, |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.15 "EC 3.6.1.15, nucleoside-triphosphatase"|, is not present in mesophilic bacteria.
/This enzyme removes the terminal phosphate group from nucleoside triphosphates, generating the corresponding diphophates.
/
/Even though the enzymes |FRAME: EC-6.3.4.2|, CTP synthase, and |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.5|, 5&prime;-nucleotidase, have not been studied in plants at this time, they are predicted to function in them |CITS: [16669783]|.

The biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and its active derivate |FRAME:THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| which serves as cofactor for a plethora of enzymes being essential in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism has been investigated in great detail in bacteria (see for example |FRAME:PWY-6894|). Less is known about the pathway in fungi, e.g. |FRAME:TAX-4932| but considerable progress has been made over the last decade (reviewed in |CITS:[18161008]|). 
/ 
/
/Besides the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| yeasts are known to employ additional salvage pathways which enables them to re-utilize degradation products of |FRAME:THIAMINE| (see |FRAME:PWY-7356|) and e.g. |FRAME:THZ-P| either from endogenous processes or through uptake from the environment |CITS:[18161008]|. The salvage of |FRAME:THZ| (this pathway) (see also the bacterial |FRAME:PWY-6897|) is possible through the enzymatic action of the bifunctional  TMP diphosphorylase/hydroxyethylthiazole kinase (THI6) |CITS:[8394314]|. Utilizing mutants deficient in either the hydroxyethylthiazole kinase or the TMP diphosphorylase activity it could be shown that yeast with a defect in the hydroxyethylthiazole kinase activity was still able to grow on |FRAME:THIAMINE| free medium. That indicates that |FRAME:THZ| is not an essential intermediate for the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE|. Instead, the hydroxyethylthiazole kinase activity is rather involved in the salvage of |FRAME:THZ| which may occur within or outside the yeast cell as a degradation product from |FRAME:THIAMINE| or other intermediates |CITS:[7982968]|.

COMMENT - <b>ARACYC</b>
/
/The presence of this pathway in Arabidopsis has been inferred based on the observation of o- and p-coumarate in Arabidopsis 
/metabolite profilies (Sumner, personal communication).
/
/<b>METACYC</b>
/
/<b>General background</b>: A widespread group of phenolics in plants termed coumarins constitute lactones 
/of phenylpropanoids with a 2H-benzopyran-2-one nucleus |CITS: [BROWN86]| |CITS: [Seigler98]|. At least 
/1000 natural occurring coumarins, among them about 300 simple coumarins have been found in many families 
/of higher plants |CITS: [BERENBAUM91]| with an especially high number of structural variations encountered in 
/the <i>Apiaceae</i> |CITS: [Seigler98]|. The biosynthesis of the simplest member described in this pathway, 
/i.e. |FRAME:COUMARIN| represents both the specific compound and serves as an eponym of the entire 
/compound class. 
/
/Coumarin belongs to the most common coumarins in plants. The numerous pharmacological and physiological 
/effects of coumarin and its more complex derivatives such as the furanocoumarins and prenylated coumarins 
/have drawn significant interest of researchers across different scientific areas. Coumarins are known to exhibit 
/anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant activities and often serve as model compounds for synthetic drugs 
/|CITS: [15579073]| |CITS: [16472213]|. Moreover, extensive research into their pharmacological and therapeutic 
/properties for many years has resulted in the acknowledgment of their therapeutic role in the treatment of cancer 
/|CITS: [15579072]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: In contrast to most of the coumarins, which are biosynthesized through 4-coumaric 
/acid and umbelliferone, the formation of coumarin occurs via 2-coumaric acid |CITS: [4153528]|. In general 
/phenylalanine and <i>trans</i>-cinnamic acid are considered the precursor for the coumarin biosynthesis but 
/Stoker |CITS: [13917373]| also reported the formation of coumarin from <i>cis</i>-cinnamic acid. Although free 
/coumarin is found in small amounts in plants their &beta;-glucoside(s) is the predominant accumulating 
/compound. The corresponding glucosyltransferase has been partially purified from and characterized in 
/<i>Melilotus alba</i> |CITS: [KLEINHOFS67]| |CITS: [16661155]|. Interestingly, the formed 
/<i>trans</i>-2-coumarate &beta;-<i>D</i>-glucoside was not accepted as substrate for the subsequent 
/&beta;-glucosidase reaction. The enzyme only catalyzed the <i>cis</i>-isomer, i.e. coumarinic acid &beta;-<i>D</i>-glucoside 
/(also referred to as bound coumarin - |CITS: [14458750]|) forming coumarinate |CITS: [13753452]|. 
/
/The way the isomerization occurs is not entirely resolved. While there is strong evidence that the <i>trans-cis</i> 
/isomerization occurs spontaneously by means of UV-light |CITS: [5921806]| |CITS: [16656000]| the existence 
/of a light-induced isomerase enzyme system has not been ruled out. Stoker |CITS: [5836500]| presented 
/evidence for the involvement of an isomerase system in this process and found that plants kept in daylight 
/or in the dark did not significantly differ with regard to the amount of coumarin. The last step of the pathway 
/is the spontaneous lactonization of coumarinate forming coumarin. 
/
/The typical 'hay' smell of coumarin is only found when plants are wounded. It has been established that the 
/glucosylated coumarins accumulate in the vacuole while the &beta;-glucosidase is located to the extraplasmatic 
/space |CITS: [16662108]|. Hence, the physical contact of the enzyme and its substrate (coumarin glucosides) 
/only occurs after the breakup of the cell and its organelles. Coumarin itself is not a dead end product but is 
/rather readily further metabolized |CITS: [13673026]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<B>General Background</B>
/
/Polyamines are widespread in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with spermine, spermidine, and putrescine being the most abundant ones. Polyamines play important roles in cell growth and differentiation, in responses to abiotic stress such as potassium deficiency, osmotic shock, drought and salt stress, and in plant-pathogen interactions. 
/
/In plants, polyamines can be degraded via two routes, the so-called terminal catabolic pathway and the back-conversion pathway. In both cases, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was produced as a by-product. In the terminal catabolic pathway, plant apoplastic polyamine oxidases (PAOs) oxidize spermine and spermidine to 1,3-diaminopropane, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the corresponding aminoaldehydes. These compounds cannot be converted directly to other polyamines. Therefore, this route is referred to as the terminal catabolic pathway |CITS: [16406305]|. In the back-conversion pathway, polyamines are interconverted.  The peroxisome-localized PAOs oxidize spermine to spermidine, and consequently oxidize spermidine to putrescine |CITS: [18583528]|. Putrescine can be further degraded by putrescine oxidase (see |FRAME: PWY-2|).
/
/<B>About This Pathway</B>
/
/In the back-conversion pathway, unlike in mammals where acetyl-derivatives of spermine and spemidine are the best substrates of PAOs, the plant PAOs characterized so far act much better on spermine and/or spermidine than their acetyl-derivatives |CITS: [18583528], [18703589], [16778015]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  L-Arabinose, the 4-epimer of D-xylose, is a monosaccharide found primarily in plants.  It is mainly present in cell wall polymers such as pectic (rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II) and hemicellulosic (xylan, xyloglucan) components, as well as in the glycosyl-moieties of proteins such as arabinogalactan proteins and extensions |CITS:[10517829],[10640355]|.  Although little is known of the incorporation of arabinose into these polymers or the contribution of the arabinosyl-substituents to the functions of the wall polymers, it has been demonstrated that arabinose-containing polymers are derived from UDP-L-arabinose, the activated sugar used by arabinosyltransferases |CITS:[FEINGOLD80]|.
/
/The formation of UDP-L-arabinose occurs via two routes: a) the <i>de novo</i> synthesis route (this pathway) involves the epimerisation of UDP-D-xylose by a UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase, and b) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-L-arabinose from free arabinose (|FRAME:PWY-82|).  
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>  Few UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerases have been described in the literature although this enzymatic activity has been described for several plants |CITS:[192218],[192219],[13821949],[5483919]|.  One has been purified from wheat germ extract.  When the enzymatic activity of this enzyme was tested, the reversible conversion of UDP-L-arabinose (UDP-L-Ara) to UDP-D-xylose (UDP-D-Xyl) was achieved with an equilibrium constant of 1.25 |CITS:[5483919]|.  More recently, the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MUR4</i> mutant was described which was shown to be affected in its ability to epimerize UDP-D-Xyl to UDP-L-Ara |CITS:[10517829],[12566589]|.  Although the MUR4 protein was expressed in transgenic yeast cells and shown to possess UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase activity, the corresponding enzyme has not yet been fully purified.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: FeS-Centers "Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters"| are cofators of |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur proteins"| and consist of a cluster of two to four iron atoms linked to sulfides, some of which are cysteine residues of the protein.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues that are coordinated with the iron atoms in regular |FRAME: CPD-6| are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, Fe-S clusters are also known to participate in
/the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes
/and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters in a living cell is a highly evolved process, requiring the assistance of complex assemblies of proteins. At present, three different biogenesis systems have been identified. The ISC (iron-sulfur cluster) system, which is present in &alpha;-, &beta;-, and &gamma;-proteobacteria as well as in mitochondria of eukaryotes, the SUF (sulfur mobilization) system, which is found in a wide range of bacteria (including cyanobacteria), archaea, and plastids of plants, and the NIF (nitrogen fixation) system, which is used in the synthesis of nitrogenase, but also occurs in nondiazotrophic  &epsilon;-proteobacteria.
/It should be noted that the mitochondrial ISC system comprises more proteins than in bacteria, but the underlying mechanistic principles are analogous. This pathway is modeled after the bacterial ISC system.
/
/All three systems have in common two key proteins - |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| (|FRAME: G7325 IscS|/|FRAME: HS01304|, |FRAME: G6906 SufS| or NifS) and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "a scaffold protein"| (|FRAME: G7324 IscU|, SufU or NifU).
/Cysteine desulfurase is a pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzyme that converts the amino-acid |FRAME: CYS| to |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, liberating a sulfur atom that is covalently bound as a persulfide at a conserved Cys residue of the enzyme.
/The scaffold protein, which also contains Cys residues, serves as a platform for the assembly of Fe-S clusters. The scaffold protein exists in equilibrium between two conformational states: a more structured state (S) and a partially disordered state (D) |CITS: [12909018][14688265][19492851]|. 
/
/The process begins when the cysteine desulfurase binds to the scaffold protein in its disordered state |CITS: [22203963]|. Sulfur atoms are transferred by the desulfurase from L-cysteine to the cysteine side chains of the scaffold protein, forming persulfides |CITS: [11577100]|.
/
/The process continues with the addition of two iron atoms, and the iron and sulfur atoms rearrange to form a [2Fe2S] cluster. The newly-formed cluster stabilizes the scaffold protein, transforming it to its structured state |CITS: [23333622]|. The process of iron addition is not well understood. The protein frataxin (|FRAME: EG11653 CyaY| in bacteria, |FRAME: G3O-29519| in yeast, FXN in humans) is essential for the process, and may act as a metallochaperone, but its weak iron binding activity and other observations suggest that its main role may be to maintain iron homeostasis under oxidative stress |CITS: [20956517][19932164][20522547]|. Another candidate for iron delivery is |FRAME: EG12132|, which has a strong binding activity for mononuclear iron, and has been shown to provide iron to the scaffold protein |FRAME: G7324 IscU| in the presence of |FRAME: G7325 IscS| and L-cysteine |CITS: [14720122][15828873][16877383]|.
/
/The next steps involve chaperone proteins. The first one, also known as a |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| (|FRAME: EG12131 HscB| in |FRAME:TAX-562|) binds to the scaffold protein, causing the cysteine desulfurase to fall off. The co-chaperone-scaffold protein complex then binds to another |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones chaperone| (|FRAME: EG12130 HscA|), which is an ATPase with a bound ATP molecule.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/The last step shown in the pathway is the exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.
/
/<b>About [4Fe-4S] clusters biosynthesis</b>
/
/While less is known about the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters, it seems that they are formed on the same scaffold proteins that are used for [2Fe-2S] clusters synthesis. These proteins are dimeric, and since a [2Fe-2S] cluster is formed within a single subunit, a dimeric scaffold protein can form two such clusters. Some evidence suggests that [4Fe-4S] clusters are formed at the subunit interface, involving two electron reductive coupling of the two adjacent [2Fe-2S] clusters |CITS: [19021507]|.
/
/The |FRAME: G7748 NfuA| protein has been proposed to be an intermediate [4Fe-4S] cluster carrier or chaperone for clusters assembled on |FRAME: G7324 IscU| |CITS: [18339629]| or act as a scaffold protein itself in some species |CITS: [15031412][15361144]|. The presence of |FRAME: EG12130| and |FRAME: EG12131| had no effect on the rate of [4Fe-4S] cluster transfer from |FRAME: G7324| to <i>apo</i> aconitase, suggesting different conformations for the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] cluster-bound forms of |FRAME: G7324 IscU|, with only the former having the ability to interact productively with |FRAME: EG12130 HscA| |CITS: [17506526]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) is a side product in the biosynthesis of several important compounds.
/An important case is polyamine synthesis, where |FRAME: MET| is consumed through the utilization of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) in a reaction that releases MTA (see the pathway |FRAME:POLYAMINSYN3-PWY|). MTA is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration needs to be tightly regulated.
/
/Another example is found in the pathogen |FRAME: TAX-287|, where MTA is a by product in the synthesis of the autoinducer compounds |FRAME: CPD-10783| and |FRAME: CPD-10784| (see |FRAME: PWY-6157|).
/
/To ensure that the pathways that produce MTA as a byproduct are not blocked, the organism must remove this compound. The most common way of achieving it is through the |FRAME: PWY-4361 "methionine salvage"| pathway, in which MTA is recycled through a series of reactions back to AMP and |FRAME: MET|.
/While the methionine salvage pathway is widely conserved, its initial steps, converting MTA to |FRAME:CPD-444|, differ among microorganisms and plants (such as the bacteria |FRAME: TAX-573| |CITS: [8694776]| and |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [12022921]|), protozoans (such as |FRAME: TAX-5741| and |FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [2854458]|) and mammalian cells. The different routes employed by these organisms are described in the different pathways under |FRAME: Methylthioadenosine-Degradation|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Higher eukaryotes possess the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-1163| (|FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE-PHOSPHORYLASE-RXN "EC 2.4.2.28"|), which converts |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| into |FRAME: CPD-444| in a single step.
/
/The enzyme draws special interest since it has been shown that all normal tissues (and cell lines established from normal tissues) show clearly detectable MTAPase activity, while a large number of cell lines derived from malignancies and primary tumors completely lacks the phosphorylase activity |CITS: [6785752]|. This may make it possible to administer drug therapies that would only affect tumor cells |CITS: [8687427]|.

CITATIONS - 18725356
CITATIONS - 18725356:EV-EXP-IMP:3432680972:dreher
COMMENT - Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a prevalent form of auxin, an important hormone that affects many aspects
/of plant growth and development |CITS: [15749753]|. Levels of biologically active IAA are tightly
/controlled by auxin synthesis, storage, transport, and inactivation processes. Indole-3-butyric acid
/(IBA) is believed to be a storage form of auxin that is generated through the addition of two methylene
/units to IAA |CITS: [15749753][18725356]|. Although some experiments indicate that IBA is a
/biologically active auxin, genetic evidence suggests that free IAA must be released from inactive IBA
/to exert an effect. IBA appears to be metabolized to
/IAA through a series of reactions reminiscent of fatty acid &beta;-oxidation |CITS: [15749753][18725356]|. 
/
/Three enzymes, IBR1, IBR3, and IBR10, believed to act in this pathway have been identified in
/Arabidopsis thaliana through
/screens for IBA resistant mutants. All three enzymes have peroxisomal targeting sequences
/and two (IBR1 and IBR10) have been identified in a study of the peroxisomal proteome in
/mature Arabidopsis leaves suggesting that IBA is metabolized to IAA in this organelle
/|CITS: [18725356][17277896] [17951448]|. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that
/mutations in several proteins required for peroxisomal biogenesis (PEX4 |CITS:[16272432]|,
/PEX5 |CITS:[ 11063705]|, PEX6 |CITS:[ 14745029]|, PEX7 |CITS:[ 15548601]|,
/PEX12 |CITS:[16113209]|) and for the import of peroxisomal substrates
/(PXA1/CTS1/PED3 |CITS:[11706205]|) cause IBA-resistant phenotypes in Arabidopsis.
/
/IBA has been identified in a number of different plant species, including |FRAME: ORG-5993|,
/|FRAME: TAX-4039|, |FRAME: TAX-4097|, |FRAME: TAX-3888|, and |FRAME: TAX-4577|
/(see references in |CITS: [LUDWIG-MULLER00]|). Moreover, proteins with a high degree of
/sequence similarity to IBR1, IBR3, and IBR10 can be found in a number of other plant species
/|CITS: [17277896][18725356]| indicating that the release of IAA from IBA may be conserved
/throughout the plant kingdom as a means of finely controlling the levels of active auxin present
/in plant cells.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleotides are found in all living organisms. They are essential components of nucleic acids, and play a crucial role in growth, development and reproduction, as well as in a large number of essential metabolic progressions such as interconversions from sugars to polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-5686|) converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|, |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (UMP). This pathway appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways as it is evolutionary conserved in all species.
/UMP is subsequently converted to other pyrimidines, as described in this pathway. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides starts with |FRAME: UMP|, and proceeds via |FRAME: UDP| to |FRAME: UTP|. |FRAME: CTP| is only formed <i>de novo</i> by deamination of |FRAME: UTP|.
/
/The first enzyme of the pathway, |FRAME: UMPKI-CPLX|, catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP.
/The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named |FRAME: AT5G26667-MONOMER| |CITS: [15604701]|.
/
/The next enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the
/terminal phosphate of a nucleoside-triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside-diphosphate - in this case, the
/transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP.
/In the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| the enzyme is encoded by a small gene family and has been demonstrated to mediate
/polar auxin transport |CITS: [15927941]| and interact with other proteins conferring stress tolerance |CITS: [12506203]|.
/
/Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleotides is made possible by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependent
/enzyme |FRAME: CTPSYN-CPLX|.

COMMENT - Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants mainly occurs in plastids, although mitochondrion is also capable to synthesize 
/fatty acids|CITS: [14660674]|. The active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis are photosynthetic leaf mesophyll cells, 
/seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. In plants, the initial condensation of an acetyl group and a malonyl group to 
/give rise to acetoacetyl-ACP is carried out by the condensing enzyme beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III. The 
/enzyme specifically uses the substrates acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP. There is no evidence for the existence, 
/or physiological significance if exists, of a bacterial version of the initial condensation reaction, which utilizes 
/acetyl-ACP and malonyl-ACP|CITS: [plantbiochemistry97],[12624762]|. 
/
/Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the controlling point for the flux of carbon into lipids. It is a biotin-containing 
/multi-enzyme complex with two activities, biotin carboxylase and carboxyl transferase, catalyzing two half 
/reactions condensing HCO3- with acetyl-CoA to yield malonyl-CoA: 
/1) BCCP + HCO3- + ATP = BCCP-CO2- + ADP + Pi (biotin carboxylase)
/2) BCCP-CO2- + acetyl-CoA = BCCP + malonyl-CoA (carboxyl transferase)
/
/Plants generally have two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the heteromeric form and the homomeric form|CITS: [12781773]|. 
/The heteromeric form is plastid-localized and involves in fatty acid biosynthesis. The homomeric form is 
/cytosolic and involves in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and synthesis of flavonoids.

TYPES - Ethanol-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - ethanol degradation II
CITATIONS - 10859180
CITATIONS - 19320993:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3462739079:kadreher
COMMENT - Plants, as well as yeast, appear to have a pathway capable of producing acetyl-CoA in the absence of
/pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). This pathway was originally identified in yeast and referred to as
/the "PDH bypass" |CITS: [11589696][8012582]|. However subsequent studies have shown that it
/also occurs in plant species, including poplar |CITS: [12231807]|, tobacco |CITS: [12000680]|, and
/Arabidopsis |CITS:[19320993]|.
/
/Other plants, including poplar, may give clues about the biological relevance of this pathway. Ethanol
/has been detected in the xylem sap of poplar |CITS: [16666209]|,
/and ethanol levels in the transpiration stream may rise after fermentation occurs in flooded roots. Trees
/may use
/alcohol dehydrogenase-dependent oxidative ethanol degradation to recover the carbon and energy
/that are invested in ethanol
/production |CITS: [12231807]| during periods of anoxia. Arabidopsis may use this pathway for a similar purpose
/or it may be employed to protect against acetaldehyde toxicity. In addition, it has been hypothesized that
/this pathway is important in the low oxygen conditions found within styles where pollen has a high
/metabolic rate |CITS:[18552233][15994907]|.
/
/This pathway appears to occur in three distinct subcellular compartments in Arabidopsis
/(see diagram in |CITS: [19320993]|). This ethanol degradation pathway is expected to begin with the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde by cytosolic alcohol
/dehydrogenases. Plants have both cytosolic and mitochondrial aldehyde
/dehydrogenases |CITS: [16656475]|. The disruption of the single cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase
/(ALDH2C4/AT3G24503) in
/Arabidopsis had no effect on ethanol incorporation into lipids, whereas mutations in the mitochondrial
/ALDH (ALDH2B/AT3G48000) did reduce the level of
/ethanol incorporation suggesting that acetaldehyde must be transported into the mitochondria
/where it is converted to acetate |CITS:[19320993]|. The single acetyl-coA synthetase identified
/in Arabidopsis is a plastidic protein |CITS:[10859180]| suggesting that the acetate produced in
/the mitochondria must be transported to the chloroplast before acetyl-coA can be produced |CITS:[19320993]|.
/ 
/Four distinct human ethanol degradation pathways have been described - three oxidative pathways
/and one nonoxidative pathway (see <A href="http://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=Ethanol-Degradation">
/MetaCyc</A>). The complete set of ethanol degradation mechanisms present in Arabidopsis have not
/yet been determined, but, the "pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass" is likely to contribute to ethanol
/metabolism in this species |CITS:[19320993]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Glutathione plays many important roles in plants. It helps maintain redox homeostasis,
/ protects against photosynthetically-generated hydrogen peroxide, aids in the sequestration of xenobiotics and heavy metals,
/ participates in cell cycle regulation, and contributes to the amino acid pools |CITS:[18768907]|. There is evidence that plants
/ and animals share many similar enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism, however, they appear to employ these
/ enzymes differently |CITS:[18768907]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: 
/In this well-studied pathway, originally identified in animals,  the &gamma;-glutamyl cycle is regarded as a
/glutathione-dependent amino acid transport system across membranes into cells such as L-cysteine,
/L-methionine, and L-glutamine |CITS:[5274454]|. Others have considered the cycle as a producer of extracellular signals,
/i.e. gamma-glutamyl amino acids, that are converted, for example to 5-oxoproline, which activates uptake
/and/or metabolism of amino acids |CITS:[2575355]|. In either case it has been demonstrated that the &gamma;-glutamyl
/cycle links the intracellular |FRAME:GLUTATHIONESYN-PWY| and the consumption of glutathione, which
/represents the major thiol and reductant in eukaryotic organisms.  
/
/The first step in the cycle comprises the formation of &gamma;-glutamyl amino acids by cleaving the
/&gamma;-peptide bond between glutamate and cysteine. Three. &gamma;-glutamyltransferase
/(GGT - syn. &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase, EC 2.3.2.2) have been identified and characterized in
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (GGT1, GGT2, and GGT4). GGT1 and GGT2 localize to the apoplast whereas GGT4
/can be found in the vacuole |CITS: [17316176][17316175][17561001]|. Phenotypic analysis of <i>ggt</i>
/mutants indicates that these enzymes have little effect on the level of 5OP. Therefore, the pathway depicted
/in this diagram is only likely to make a minimal contribution to glutathione metabolism within Arabidopsis plants. 
/
/Many of the later steps of the pathway are conserved between the |FRAME: PWYQT-4470| variant and this pathway.
/
/First, a &gamma;-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGC) and 5-oxoprolinase (5OPase) produce 5-oxoproline and
/L-glutamate, respectively. The 5OPase has been identified in Arabidopsis |CITS:[18768907]| and GGC activity
/has also been measured, even though this activity has not been linked to a single locus |CITS:[18768907]|.  Similar
/experiments from other plants also confirm the presence of these enzymatic activities
/|CITS:[9601076]| |CITS:[7445678]| |CITS:[16660609]| |CITS:[11302195]|. The final steps to close
/the cycle are carried out by glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione-synthase. The formation of the
/amide linkage between cysteine and glutamate is catalyzed by the glutamate-cysteine ligase; the reaction
/has been regarded as rate-limiting step in the formation of glutathione and was characterized in
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [1112810]| |CITS: [MAY94]|. Glutathione synthetase is a
/physiological dimer and catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of L-&gamma;-glutamylcysteine to glutathione.
/The enzyme has been found and characterized in Arabidopsis confirming its molecular function by recombinant
/expressed protein and functional complementation of glutathione synthase deficient heterologous organisms
/|CITS: [8612643]| |CITS: [8914526]| |CITS: [15302873]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate (hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate) in plant cells.  Phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth.  It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) known as phytin |CITS:[11590064],[8744268]|.  Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin |CITS:[15700415]|.  Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see |CITS:[14568069]|).  The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties.  Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract.  Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption.  Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution |CITS:[11590064],[11906835]|.  The degradation of phytate is achieved by a group of enzymes called phytases which have been mostly studied in microorganisms and plants.  Phytases belong to a special class of phosphomonoesterases and are capable of initiating the stepwise release of phosphate from phytate.  Phytases are used to reduce the level of phosphate pollution in areas of intensive animal production.  Addition of adequate amounts of microbial phytases in animal feed improves the utilization of phosphate from phytate, allowing for a reduction in inorganic phosphate supplementation in the diets for simple-stomached animals.  As a result, the fecal phosphate excretion of these animals may be reduced by up to 50%.  Finally, phytases can improve the nutritional value of plant-based foods (especially grains) by increasing the availability of the minerals chelated in phytin.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>  The degradation of phytate into <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate intermediates and, finally, <i>myo</i>-inositol, is performed by phytases which catalyze the removal of all the phosphate residues of the phytate molecule in a sequential order.  Each <i>myo</i>-inositol intermediate is released from the enzyme and may become a substrate for further hydrolysis |CITS:[12405789]|.  To date two main types of phytases have been described: 3-phytases (<i>myo</i>-inositol hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate 3-phosphorylase, EC 3.1.3.8) and 4-phytases (<i>myo</i>-inositol hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate 6-phosphorylase, EC 3.1.3.26), which lead to the production of 
/Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P<sub>5</sub> and Ins(1,2,3,5,6)P<sub>5</sub>, respectively, from phytate.  The main phytate degradation route elucidated in legumes, cereals, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>, then, goes from the conversion of either of these two compounds to Ins(1,2,5,6)P<sub>4</sub>, Ins(1,2,6)P<sub>3</sub> and Ins(1,2)P<sub>2</sub> |CITS:[12405789]|.  A minor route proceeds through the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,2,3,5,6)P<sub>5</sub> to Ins(1,2,3,6)P<sub>4</sub>.  This minor branch results from lesser activities from the same enzymes involved in the catalysis of the reaction of the main branch, rather than that of the activity of a different set of enzymes |CITS:[12405789],[10879469]|.
/
/<b>Note on Inositol Phosphates:</b>  Inositol phosphates containing the (1,2,3)-trisphosphate cluster are iron-binding antioxidants |CITS:[9034232],[spiers95]|, and Ins(1,2,3,6)P<sub>4</sub> has a structure that is moderately effective in opening calcium channels  |CITS:[9160166],[8141257]|.  In addition, Ins(1,2,6)P<sub>3</sub> has anti-inflammatory and antisecretory properties |CITS:[claxon90]|.

COMMENT - Serine biosynthesis in plants proceeds by two pathways, the so called
/phosphorylated pathway and the glycolate pathway. In the phosphorylated
/pathway (depicted here), serine is derived from 3-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of
/glycolysis. This pathway also operates in bacteria, yeast, and animals.
/In the glycolate pathway, which is part of photorespiration (|FRAME: PWY-181|),
/serine is derived from glycolate via glycine. The glycolate pathway
/dominates in the photosynthetic tissues. Most of the serine produced in this
/pathway continues with the photorespiration pathway and is returned to
/Calvin cycle via hydroxypyruvate and glycerate. The phosphorylated
/pathway is thought to contribute to serine biosynthesis in the dark and
/in non-photosynthetic tissues. Genes of the phosphorylated pathway are
/upregulated by high salinity, flood and cold. It indicates that the
/phosphorylated pathway is also important in supplying serine under
/environmental stresses.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/|FRAME:2-CARBOXY-D-ARABINITOL-1-PHOSPHATASE| (CA1P) limits photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation at low light because it is a potent, naturally occurring inhibitor of Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; see |FRAME:CALVIN-PWY|).  Indeed, Rubisco is only active when an essential lysine residue within the large subunit is carbamylated with CO<SUB>2</SUB> followed by coordination of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to form a ternary complex at the catalytic site |CITS:[11848907]|.  CA1P is a naturally occurring analogue of the transition-state of the carboxylase reaction.  Its tight binding to the active site of carbamylated Rubisco inhibits the enzyme's catalytic activity |CITS:[GUTTERIDGE86],[16593807]|. CA1P is important in the diurnal regulation of photosynthesis, particularly during periods of low irradiance or darkness. On transition from dark to light, Rubisco activase promotes the release of CA1P from the catalytic site of Rubisco |CITS:[ROBINSON88]|, and free CA1P is rendered noninhibitory by the action of a light-activated CA1P-phosphatase.  CA1P has been shown to be synthesized in a variety of plant species including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[16668153]| but its biosynthetic pathway has only been determined by radiotracer experiments |CITS:[16669073],[11917127]| and no enzymes of this biosynthetic process have been characterized.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are secondary metabolites in the order of Capparales that includes families such as Brassicaceae. 
/Glucosinolates are stored in the vacuole and come into contact with the enzyme myrosinase upon breakage of the 
/cell. Myrosinase de-glucosylates the glucosinolates which causes them to re-arrange into nitriles,  isothiocyanates 
/and thiocyanates. The precise product that is formed depends on the glucosinolate and whether an epithiospecifier 
/protein is present. The breakdown products give the typical sharp taste and odor to many of the members of 
/brassicaceae that are used as spices such as raddish and mustard. Arabidopsis has been shown to 
/accumulate at least 23 different glucosinolates; they accumulate in both seeds and leaves. Glucosinolates are grouped 
/into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, depending on whether they are derived from methionine, phenylalanine 
/and tyrosine, or tryptophan. For an excellent review, see |CITS: [12049923]|. Indolylmethyl glucosinolates are found 
/mainly in leaves.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Eukaryotes synthesize asparagine-linked glycans using the lipid-linked precursor, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide.  Animals, plants, most fungi, <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> (slime mold), and <i>Euglena gracilis</i> use this tetradecasaccharide (14-sugar) precursor, although other protists glycosylate the precursor differently |CITS: [15665075], [6088086], [DELACANAL]|.  The pathway for N-glycosylation is highly conserved.  There is sequence similarity between some of the eukaryotic glycosyltransferases and bacterial transferases involved in murein and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.  In addition, an N-linked protein glycosylation pathway similar to eukaryotes is found in the archaea (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|).  The biosynthetic pathway for this lipid-linked precursor begins with the phosphorylation of dolichol, followed by stepwise addition of sugar residues to form the product dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide.  This pathway is of particular interest in humans, because defects in the glycosyltransferases involved lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation.  The genetic analysis of this pathway in a model organism, the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, has helped to elucidate the molecular basis of these disorders (reviewed in |CITS: [11306275]|).  Note that in plants, little information is known concerning the biosynthesis of dolichols |CITS:[15336563]|.
/
/Dolichyl phosphate is the essential carrier lipid for glycosyl residues.  Each of the glycosyl residues is added by a specific glycosyltransferase, although not all have been defined |CITS:[10517826]|.  Reactions in this pathway without defined or putative enzymes are indicated as hypothetical.  The substrate specificity of these enzymes results in a highly ordered assembly of glycosyl residues |CITS: [10336995]|.
/
/Very little information regarding this pathway is available for the species <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"|-containing phospholipids play an important role in the control of cellular functions within eukaryotic cells, being part of the intracellular signal transductions pathways from various regulators, including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and serum |CITS: [164246]|. When these regulators interact with their receptors in cell membranes, they induce the hydrolysis of certain |FRAME: Phosphoinositides "phosphoinositides"| to produce second messenger molecules.
/
/|FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-5-PHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate"| was discovered
/in 1997 in mammalian fibroblasts as a source for |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"| |CITS: [9367159]|, and is still considered the least-characterized member of the phosphoinositol family. It is believed to play a role as a regulator of membrane trafficking |CITS: [18774718]|. 
/
/The best established pathway for the synthesis of |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-5-PHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate"| is the dephosphorylation of |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, catalyzed by a number of myotubularin-related phosphatases, such as |FRAME: HS02045| |CITS: [11676921]| and |FRAME: HS08920| |CITS: [17008356]|.
/Another source for the compound is the removal of the 4-phosphate group from |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA| by either of two dedicated  phsphatases, encoded by |FRAME: HS14553| and |FRAME: HS15363| |CITS: [16365287]|.
/
/It has been shown that |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-5-PHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate"| is phosphorylated to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA| by |FRAME: HS07693-MONOMER|, encoded by |FRAME: HS07693| |CITS: [9367159]|. However, the concentration of |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-5-PHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate"| in the cell is very low (about 2% of |FRAME: CPD-1108 "phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate"|), and thus it is unlikely that its main role is as a source of |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA| biosynthesis. However, the exact role of this compound in the cell is still unknown.

COMMENT - beta-caryophyllene is bicyclic sesquiterpenoid found in the essential oils of Cannabis sativa, Clove and rosemary. The beta-caryophyllene is the first dietary cannabinoid approved by FDA. It selectively binds to the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and (CB2). It is used in the treatment regimens of inflamation, pain, osteoporosis and atheroscelerosis |CITS: [18574142]|. (E)-BCP is identified as a functional nonpsychoactive CB2 receptor ligand in foodstuff and as a macrocyclic antiinflammatory cannabinoid in Cannabis |CITS: [18574142]|. As a component of clove oil extracted from syzigium, used in herbal medicine to treat pain, it is shown to posses aneasthetic activity |CITS: [11482764 ]|.
/
/Since it is extensively used as a fragrance chemical in food and cosmetics, its allergen potential was evaluated and shown that it rapidly oxidizes upon exposure to air and the caryophyllene oxide can be a mild skin allergen |CITS: [16226832]|.
/
/The enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of FPP to form beta-caryophyllene has been characterized from a  number of plant species included maize where it has been shown that this trait was lost and regained during cycles of domestication |CITS: [18296628]|.

COMMENT - This pathway occurs in the plastid. It supplies CDP-diacylglycerol for phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis.

/
/Note that this pathway is different from |FRAME: PWY-5667|. For the two acyl transfer reactions, the 
/acyl donors are acyl-ACP, not acyl-CoA. In this pathway, phosphatidylglycerol is assembled de novo 
/from the newly synthesized fatty acids (acyl-ACPs) within the plastid. It is also referred as the 
/prokaryotic pathway. In Arabidopsis, this pathway accounts for about 85% of phosphatidylglycerol in the

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is able to utilize |FRAME: D-SERINE| as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen for growth |CITS: [1090588]|.  D-serine also has a bacteriostatic effect due to its effect on the biosynthesis of L-serine and pantothenate |CITS: [4574697]|.  Detoxification of D-serine and its utilization as a carbon and nitrogen source are accomplished by a single enzyme, |FRAME: DSERDEAM-MONOMER| |CITS: [14216615]|.  D-serine ammonia-lyase catalyzes the deamination of D-serine to form pyruvate and ammonia; expression of the enzyme is induced by D-serine |CITS: [13271312][14216615][14216616]|.  
/
/Recently, it has been shown that the ability to utilize and/or detoxify D-serine plays a role in pathogenesis |CITS: [12823810][17088369][17785472][19674114]|.
/
/The vertebrate brain contains significant amounts of |FRAME: D-SERINE| which has a role in <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function. In the mammalian brain |FRAME: D-SERINE| produced from |FRAME: SER| by the bifunctional serine racemase/D-serine dehydratase is mainly degraded by |FRAME:  EC-1.4.3.3|. However in the avian brain, D-amino acid oxidase is not expressed and |FRAME: D-SERINE| is degraded by |FRAME: EC-4.3.1.18| (D-serine dehydratase). In other avian tissues, both enzymes are present |CITS: [17254537][21676877]|. D-serine dehydratase has also been identified in yeast |CITS: [17937657]|. Like mammals, plants have a bifunctional serine racemase/D-serine dehydratase |CITS: [16483618]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6196|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen 
/species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses such as 
/drought, air pollutants, UV light and high light intensities, chilling temperatures and external chemicals 
/|CITS: [VANBREUSGEM99]| |CITS: [11997379]|. ROS such as superoxide- and hydroxyl radicals as well 
/as hydrogen peroxide can cause significant damage to cell organelles accommodating vital metabolic processes 
/such as photosynthesis and respiration. 
/
/Plants have developed a defense system to face oxidative stress and scavenge oxidative radicals in form of 
/enzymes that can detoxify ROS, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (this pathway) 
/|CITS: [BEYER87]|. Active oxygen species are produced during the beta-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result 
/of photorespiration |CITS: [8819328]|. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a member of the mustard family (oilseed 
/plants) stores energy reserves preliminary as lipids that undergo &beta;-oxidation during germination. As a 
/result of that metabolic process H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is produced which is detoxified by catalase. 
/Superoxide radicals are by-products of any electron chain operating in plant cells which are disposed by 
/superoxide dismutase. As a result ROS can be found in any compartment of the cell and plants have developed 
/small gene families encoding for SOD and CAT that are operating in the various cell compartments |CITS: [9765550]|
/|CITS: [9214587]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: SOD's represent the first line of defense against ROS converting superoxide 
/radicals to hydrogen peroxide and water. SOD's are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor. There 
/are iron-dependent, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SOD's found in plants which differ not 
/only by their metal cofactor but also by their subcellular location. FeSOD's are located in chloroplasts and are 
/regarded as the most ancient SOD group. MnSOD's are found in the mitochondrion and the peroxisome and 
/are structurally very similar to FeSOD's. The last group, the Cu-ZnSOD's operates in chloroplasts, the cytosol 
/and even extracellular space. They are structurally very different from the other two SOD groups because 
/of the different electrical properties of copper in comparison to iron or manganese that caused a major structural 
/change of the protein |CITS: [11997379]|.
/
/To date seven SOD's have been identified Arabidopsis, three of them iron-dependent, three having copper as 
/metal cofactor and one manganese-dependent SOD |CITS: [1731963]| |CITS: [2263641]| |CITS: [9765550]|. 
/It has been demonstrated that a copper-chaperone (AtCCS, At1g12520) is crucial for the activation of all three 
/Cu/Zn-dependent SOD's in Arabdiopsis . The SOD holoenzyme usually constitutes either a homodimer or a homotetramer. However, the exact composition of the SOD's in Arabidopsis is currently not known and remains to be verified (here displayed as polypeptides).   
/
/Catalase is second in the defense line against active oxygen converting hydrogen peroxide into water and 
/oxygen. Three genes encoding subunits of catalase and at least 6 catalase isoenzymes have been identified 
/in Arabidopsis so far |CITS: [12232134]| |CITS: [9214587]| |CITS: [8819328]| |CITS: [8668130]|. Besides their 
/implication in detoxifying ROS, catalase is thought to play a role in the signal transduction pathway in plants 
/leading to the development of SAR (systemic aquired resistance) |CITS: [7953568]|. The functional protein of 
/catalase is a tetramer but the question whether it exists as homo- or heterotetramer of the corresponding 
/subunits remains to be investigated.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The first purine nucleotide that is synthesized <i>de novo</i> is |FRAME: IMP| (IMP).
/IMP is converted to |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER|,
/and the later is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, |FRAME: AMP| (AMP), by the action of
/|FRAME:AMPSYN-ENZRXN|.
/
/AMP is phosphorylated to ADP and subsequently to ATP. The first reaction is catalyzed by
/|FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|. Reactions that convert ADP to ATP are numerous and found in multiple pathways, including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-cycle based aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis. However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: CPLX490-3510 ATP synthase| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes the proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP. This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.
/
/In some bacteria ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form (see |FRAME:PWY-7220|).
/
/Genetic studies indicate that in bacterial systems the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the |FRAME: PC00033| |CITS:[2404765]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.
/While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also
/induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/
/Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (lipid A), a core polysaccharide, and polysaccharide
/(<i>O</i>) side chains.
/Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negatives, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide
/is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the <i>O</i> side chains
/are variable in structure and toxicity.
/The core polysaccharide usually consists of about 20-40 repeated subunits.
/
/KDO is a part of the inner core. It is added to the lipid A precursor |FRAME: LIPID-IV-A| in sequential steps, with different KDO units added by different linkages. The first unit is added by a (2->6) glycosidic linkage, the second one by a (2->4) linkage. In |FRAME: TAX-810| additional KDO units are added by a (2->8) o r(2->4)  linkages (see |FRAME: PWY-6467|).
/
/Many organisms have monofunctional enzymes that catalyze one of these steps. |FRAME: TAX-562| has a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the addition of two KDO units with different glycosidic linkages.
/
/KDO-containing |FRAME: LIPID-IV-A| molecules are intermediates; further acylation reactions are needed to produce the final KDO(<sub>n</sub>-Lipid A moiety.
/
/There is some evidence that lipid A or its precursors are synthesized in plants |CITS: [21709257][16935939]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information</b>:
/
/There is no convincing evidence for the occurence of free mannose in plants other than during the breakdown of reserve mannans of seeds and the storage mannans of certain vegetative organs.  Release of free mannose from storage polymers requires the cooperative activity of &alpha;-glycosidases, &beta;-mannanases and &beta;-mannosidases (for review, see |CITS:[HEROLD77]|).  Nevertheless, |FRAME:MANNOSE| is a common constituent of carbohydrates and glycoproteins in the cell wall.  Following a study of two hexokinases (HKs) in spinach (hexokinases I and II), which were shown to have very low apparent <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values for mannose and high mannokinase activity, it was postulated that those enzymes might contribute to an apparent lack of free mannose in green leaves |CITS:[Schnarrenberger90]|.  In general, mannose is transported into the cell and phosphorylated by HK with an efficiency comparable to glucose. However, the metabolism of |FRAME:MANNOSE-6P| by either hexose phosphate isomerase (as depicted in this pathway; EC 5.3.1.8) or hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is inefficient (for review, see |CITS:[7827498]|).

CITATIONS - 10671542:EV-EXP:3512844716:peifenz
COMMENT - In plants, the major site for fatty acid biosynthesis is plastids. However it is known that mitochondria of eukaryotes are also capable of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. For example, synthesis of fatty acyl-ACP from labeled malonate was detected in isolated mitochondria from pea |CITS: [10671542]|, and from Neurospora |CITS: [2137086]|.
/
/The plant mitochondrial pathway differs from the |FRAME: PWY-4381 "plastidic pathway"|. First, in the mitochondrial pathway, malonate, not acetyl-CoA, is the sole precursor of fatty acids, although the source of malonate is still poorly understood |CITS: [10671542]|. Second, malonyl-ACP serves as both the primer and donor substrates for de novo fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [14660674]|. Third, there is only one condensing enzyme involved in the mitochondrial pathway. In contrast to the three condensing enzymes in the plastids, KASIII, KASI and KASII, where each carry out the initial condensation, elongation from C4 to C16, and the elongation from C16 to C18 reactions, respectively, the mitochondrial condensing enzyme carries out both the priming and all the elongating reactions |CITS: [14660674]|. 
/
/The biological role of the mitochondrial pathway is not entirely clear. One role is to provide octanoyl-ACP for the |FRAME: PWY0-501 "biosynthesis of lipoate"|, an important sulfur-containing cofactor of a number of enzymes such as glycine decarboxylase complex and pyruvate dehydrogenase |CITS: [10671542]|. Another role is likely to provide fatty acyl chains for the |FRAME: PWY-5269 "synthesis of cardiolipin"|, a lipid unique to mitochondrial membranes |CITS: [Li-Beisson2010]|. 
/
/The pathway does not appear to operate in grasses (Poaceae) |CITS: [12972648]|.

COMMENT - <b> General background</b> Thiols play several major roles in the cell; they help maintain the redox balance, keep a reduced environment,
/fight reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and they are involved in the detoxification of many other toxins and 
/stress-inducing factors (see  glutathione-mediated detoxification  ). In most organisms, the major thiol is the tripeptide
/glutathione  (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as GSH).
/
/Most of the glutathione pool is kept in its reduced form. For example, in E. coli, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione
/is 200:1|CITS: [11544348 ]|. The functionality of GSH largely depends on its being in a reduced form.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/Oxidative damage to proteins often results in the formation of mixed disulfides within the polypetides. A primary defense
/against this damage is mediated by the action of GSH-dependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, also called
/thioltransferases and best known as glutaredoxins (Grx). These proteins reduce the protein disulfide groups back to
/their native form |CITS: [9571241]|. At least one functional glutathione disulfide reductase has been identified in Arabidopsis |CITS: [KUBO93]|. 
/
/The glutaredoxins, which are oxidized during this process, are reduced back to active form with electrons
/that are donated by reduced GSH molecules. In this reaction, two molecules of the reduced form GSH are oxidized,
/condensing into the single molecule glutathione disulfide . The disulfide is reduced back into two individual GSH
/molecules by the action of the enzyme glutathione reductase. 
/
/Another redox cycle involving glutathione, which is found in eukaryotic organisms, is described in |FRAME: PWY-4081|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>:  The biosynthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) occurs <i>via</i> two

/considered to be the sole source of IPP in all living organisms, however, several inconsistencies led to 
/the discovery of the MEP pathway in bacteria and plants.  In the latter the MVA pathway is located in 
/the cytosol whilst the MEP pathway is found in plastids |CITS: [Lichtenthaler97]| |CITS: [12735695]|.  
/
/In eukaryotic cells, the mevalonate pathway leads to |FRAME:PWY-2541|, |FRAME:ERGOSTEROL-SYN-PWY| 
/and dolichols <i>via</i> the formation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). IPP from this pathway is also used 
/to synthesize cytosolic geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) which is used (along with FPP) for the prenylation 
/of proteins.  In plants, the mevalonate pathway is also a source of isoprene units for the biosynthesis of a 
/variety of terpenoids (cytokinins, brassinosteroids, sesquiterpenes, polyprenoids) |CITS: [BOCHAR99]|. 
/However, the MVA pathway appears not to function independently from the MEP pathway but rather interacts 
/through metabolic cross-talk |CITS: [12736259]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: This pathway described as mevalonat pathway displays the enzymatic steps 
/that lead to mevalonate and the further conversion towards dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMPP) one of the 
/crucial intermediates that give rise to several terpenoid and plant hormone pathways. Most of the enzymes 
/characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> from this pathway have been demonstrated to be fully functional, 
/largely through functional complementation of bacterial and yeast mutant strains.
/
/The first enzyme of the pathway, i.e. acetoacetyl (AcAc)-CoA thiolase (AACT; EC 2.3.1.9) that catalyzes the 
/condensation of two acetyl-CoA to form acetoacetyl-CoA has not yet been identified in Arabidopsis. The 
/following enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) catalyzes the formation of the thermodynamically 
/favourable aldol condensation of one molecule of AcAc-CoA with acetyl-CoA to form one molecule of S-HMG-CoA 
/|CITS: [8566777]|. The proposal that the conversion from acetyl-CoA to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA comprising 
/two enzymatic steps is carried out by a single enzyme |CITS: [1685759]| |CITS: [8123686]| was not confirmed 
/as the yeast mutant deficient in acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase could not be functionally complemented. The isolation 
/and characterization of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase from <i>Brassica juncea</i> indicates that 
/those conversions are conducted by two independent proteins |CITS: [15233626]|.
/
/The last enzymatic step to form mevalonate is accomplished by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, 
/which are encoded in Arabidopsis by two genes HMG1 and HMG2 from which HMG1 forms two isoforms, HMGR1S 
/and HMGR1L |CITS: [10333388]|. The enzyme is located within the Endoplasmatic Reticulum (ER) but has 
/also been found within new and so far unidentified vesicular structures in the cytoplasm and within the vacuole 
/of differentiated cotyledon cells  |CITS: [15618432]|.
/
/The remaining steps towards DMPP comprise two phosphorylation steps to convert mevalonate to mevalonate-5-diphosphate 
/|CITS: [7958957]| |CITS: [10794536]|. Following the ATP-dependent decarboxylation of mevalonate-5-diphosphate 
/to generate isopentenyl-pyrophosphate (IPP) |CITS: [10344201]| the final enzyme of the pathway, isopentenyl-diphosphate 
/delta-isomerase encoded by two genes (IPP1, IPP2) forms dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMPP) |CITS: [9484444]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Of the ten existing hexitols (|FRAME: CPD-15703|, |FRAME: CPD-12811|, |FRAME: CPD-15702|, |FRAME: SORBITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-12810|, |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-15701|, |FRAME: CPD-357|, |FRAME: CPD-369| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|) only three occur naturally - |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: SORBITOL| (also known as D-glucitol), and |FRAME: GALACTITOL| (owing to symmetry, D- and L-galactitol are identical).
/Each of these can be utilized by bacteria as a total source of carbon and energy.
/
/Sorbitol is one of several acyclic polyols or sugar alcohols found in higher plants |CITS:[BIELESKI82]|. In Rosaceae plants, sorbitol is the main photoassimilate produced in the leaves from which it is translocated to sink tissues |CITS:[WEBB62][BIELESKI85]|. Sorbitol synthesis shares a common hexose phosphate pool with sucrose synthesis, and it was recently shown in apple that synthesis pathways are not independent from one another |CITS:[ZHOU02]| as
/|FRAME:MONOMER-11709| was shown to be inhibited by |FRAME:D-SORBITOL-6-P|, an intermediate in sorbitol biosynthesis.  
/
/D-sorbitol degradation is common in prokaryotes. For example, |FRAME: TAX-1423| can utilize it as a sole carbon source via the <i>gut</i> operon (glucitol-utilizing transporter), consisting of a transporter and an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent glucitol dehydrogenase |CITS: [6402486][12897001]|.
/
/The pathway also occurs in plants, as translocated sorbitol is 'unloaded' in fruit tissues and eventually converted to fructose. In plants that use sorbitol as the main product of photosynthesis D-sorbitol dehydrogenase is a key enzyme, supplying carbon during fruit development.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/|FRAME:UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (UDP-GlcNAc) plays an important role in protein and lipid glycosylation in eukaryotes. The glycans on cell surface glycoproteins are instrumental for cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions, although their exact function is poorly understood |CITS:[8278542]|.
/
/Asn (N)-linked glycans (N-glycans) are components of most membrane-associated and secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells. N-glycans are assembled by the initial step of the transfer of a synthesized dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursor en bloc to a nascent polypeptide chain in the endoplasmic reticulum (see |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS|) |CITS:[17138701]|.  UDP-GlcNAc also involves the generation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkers for anchoring a variety of cell surface molecules to the plasma membrane. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol assembly initiates with the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to |FRAME:L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols| (see reaction |FRAME:2.4.1.198-RXN|) |CITS:[15772281]|, which is catalyzed by <i>O</i>-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine transferases (OGTs).  OGT activity is required during gametogenesis and embryogenesis |CITS:[12136030]|.
/
/Generation of UDP-GlcNAc is possible by both <i>de novo</i> synthesis (this pathway) and salvage pathways, and the respective enzymes have been identified |CITS:[FEINGOLD87]|.  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, enzymes have been predicted to catalyze all the steps of this pathway, but their catalytic activities remain to be ascertained.

COMMENT - In addition to being a building blocks for protein synthesis, asparagine, along with glutamate, glutamine, and
/aspartate, are used to transport nitrogen throughout the plant, and they represent 70% total free amino 
/acids in Arabidopsis. Nitrogen is first assimilated from the soil into glutamine and glutamate via 
/glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, and later into aspartate and asparagine via aspartate 
/aminotransferase and asparagine synthetase. 
/
/There are six genes in Arabidopsis that encode aspartate aminotransferase, two for the cytosolic 
/isoform (ASP2 and ASP4), two (ASP5 and AtAAT) for the chloroplast, one (ASP1) for mitochondrial, 
/and one (ASP3) for peroxisomal. ASP2 encodes the major cytosolic isoform. It is responsible for 
/synthesizing the bulk of aspartate in the light, which supplies the precursor for asparagine synthesis in 
/the dark|CITS: [12068109]|. The chloroplast, mitochondrial and peroxisomal isoforms, along with 
/malate dehydrogenase, are predicted to be involved in shuttling reducing powers (NADH) between 
/subcellular compartments via the malate-aspartate shuttle|CITS: [16623902]|. 
/
/There are three genes in Arabidopsis encoding asparagine synthetase. ASN1 and ASN2 are the 
/predominantly expressed genes, and they are mainly detected in the shoots.
/ASN1 is indicated to be involved in asparagine synthesis in the dark, for nitrogen storage and transport. 
/ASN2 is predicted to be involved in asparagine synthesis in the light, for protein biosynthesis, or for 
/ammonia detoxification under ammonia rich conditions|CITS: [9881155]|.

COMMENT - Photosynthesis is composed of two processes, the light reactions and the dark reactions.
/The light reactons take place in the two photosystems - photosystem I and photosystem II, where light
/energy is harvested and is used to power the transfer of electrons from water, via a series of electron
/donors and acceptors, to the final acceptor NADP+, which is reduced to NADPH.
/The NADPH generated by the light reactions is used for sugar synthesis in the dark reactions.
/
/The light reactions also generate a proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, and the proton
/gradient is used to synthesize ATP. 
/
/There are two general chemical reactions involved in the light reactions: water oxidation in photosystem II,
/and NADP reduction in photosystem I. Both of the photosystems are large multiprotein complexes contained within
/the thylakoid membranes of all types of plants, algae and cyanobacteria, and both photosystems
/capture the light by means of large antennae systems, consisting of chlorophylls and carotenoids.
/
/|FRAME: CPLX490-3506| (PSII) utilizes solar energy for splitting water molecules, and transfers the
/electrons obtained from the water molecule via an electron transfer chain that ends with
/|FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE|.
/
/The excitation of the photosystem II reaction center (RC) via light absorption by chlorophylls in the
/antenna drives the transfer of a very high potential electron from the cluster of four chlorophylls bound to
/the D1- and D2-proteins (known as P680) to a pheophytin acceptor, resulting in a P680* radical.
/The radical transfers the electron to a firmly bound |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE| (PQ) called QA, which transfers it to a second, not firmly bound PQ, called QB.
/When QB is fully reduced and protonated to |FRAME: PLASTOQUINOL-1| (PQH2) form, it diffuses from the QB-binding
/site into the lipid matrix of the membrane (for more information about the mechanism of photosystem II,
/see |FRAME:CPLX490-3506|).
/
/The path between the two photosystems is not direct. The QB plastoquinone first transfers the electrons
/to a third complex, the plastoquinol--plastocyanin reductase (better known as the |FRAME:CPLX490-29|,
/EC 1.10.99.1), where the electrons are transferred to the protein |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1088-MONOMER|.
/Finally |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1088-MONOMER| travels to |FRAME: CPLX-84|, and delivers the electrons to one
/of its components, P700, which is located on the inside of the thylakoids (the lumen).
/
/|FRAME:CPLX490-3509| (PS I) catalyzes the light driven electron transfer from |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_1088-MONOMER|
/to |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, which is on the stromal side of the membrane.
/As in photosystem II, photosystem I performs both light capturing and electron transfer.
/The light capturing is performed by the large antenna system that consists of 90 antenna chlorophylls
/and 22 carotenoids. The electron transport chain consists of six chlorophylls, two phylloquinones
/and three |FRAME:CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters"|.
/
/The electron transfer chain of PS I starts with P700, a heterodimer of a |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A| and
/a |FRAME: CPD-10334| (the C13 epimer of chlorophyll a). As in photosystem II, a high energy electron is removed
/from P700 after excitation by light, and that electron is transferred through the system. The role of
/the electron delivered from photosystem II by plastocyanin is to re-reduce P700.
/
/From P700 the electron is transferred stepwise to A (a |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|  molecule),
/A0 (another |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-A|  molecule), A1 (a
/|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE| molecule) and then through three 4Fe4S
/clusters, named FX, FA and FB.
/From the terminal 4Fe4S cluster, FB, the electron is transferred to the 2Fe2S cluster of
/|FRAME:Ferredoxins|, which leaves photosystem I and transfers the electron to the
/|FRAME:SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (EC 1.18.1.2), where NADP+ is finally reduced to NADPH.
/Under conditions of iron limitation, |FRAME: Flavodoxin| may replace the ferredoxin |CITS: [15977059]|.
/
/Cyanobacterial PS I can exist in both trimeric and monomeric forms. The trimeric form has been shown
/to be the prominent oligomeric state at low light intensity.
/The monomeric unit of PSI from |FRAME:TAX-32046| consists of 12 protein subunits, to which 127
/cofactors are non-covalently bound. 
/
/Some components of photosystem I and photosystem II in plants are different from those in
/photosynthetic microbes.

COMMENT - Pectin is one of the major components of the primary cell wall of plants composed of four structurally
/distinct poly saccharides namely homogalacturonan (HG),  rhamnogalcturonan I (RG-I), rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II)
/and Xylogalacturonan (XGA). Although all the four components appear to be present in all cells but their
/relative abundance and structural details differ between cell types and species |CITS: [17827695]|.
/
/Golgi vesicles are the site of pectin biosynthesis and its structural complexity indicates that a large number
/of enzymes must be involved in the process. Glycosyltransferases (GT) and decorating enzymes such as
/methyltransferases, acetyltransferases and feruloyltransferases are involved in the biosynthetic process.
/
/Evidence indicate a role for pectin in plant growth, development, morphogenesis, defense, cell adhesion,
/wall structure, signaling, cell expansion, wall porosity, binding of ions, growth factors and enzymes,
/pollen tube growth, seed hydration, leaf abscission, and fruit development |CITS: [15377216]||CITS: [11554482]|.
/Pectin is also used in the food and cosmetic industries. Pectin has been shown to have several positive
/effects on human health |CITS: [17513886]|.
/
/Xylogalacturonan
/
/Xylogalacturonan (XGA) is a substituted homogalacturonan (HG). In XGA, the &alpha;-1,4-linked
/galacturonic acid backbone is substituted at O-3 with a &beta linked xylose. Occasionally the xylose is
/further substituted at O-4 with an additional &beta linked xylose. The HG backbone is partially
/methylesterified at the C-6 carboxyl, may be O-acetylated at O-2 or O-3. 
/
/Although XGA has been reported to be abundant in reproductive tissues of many plants recently also been

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many type of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: CTP| is one of the building blocks of RNA. It is synthesized <i>de novo</i> from |FRAME: UTP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7176|).
/However, when |FRAME: CMP| is available via salvage of cytidine nucleosides, it can be phosphorylated to CTP by the action of two kinases.
/
/The first phosphorylation, from |FRAME: CMP| to |FRAME: CDP|, is catalyzed in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 "(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)"| and in eukaryotes by the bifunctional |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 "UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)"|.
/
/The second phophorylation, from |FRAME: CDP| to |FRAME: CTP|, is catalyzed in all organisms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"|.

COMMENT - Above-ground epidermal surfaces of vascular plants are covered by a lipophilic layer known as the 
/cuticle. The cuticle functions as a barrier to control the movement of gas, water and solute, as well as 
/plant pathogens. Plant cuticles are composed of cutin and cuticular wax. Cutin is a polymer 
/comprised of cutin monomers that are attached to each other by an ester linkage. Cutin monomers 
/include C16 and C18 fatty acids and their derivatives, and glycerol. Among the fatty acid derivatives, 
/&omega;-hydroxy-, polyhydroxy-, and epoxy-fatty acids are typical cutin monomers. 
/&alpha;,&omega;-dicarboxylic acids are signatures of suberin (see |FRAME: PWY-1121|), and are generally found 
/in trace level in cutin. However, they count for more than 50% of cutin monomers in Arabidopsis.
/
/Among the enzymes characterized for the pathway, the Arabidopsis CYP86A8 and CYP94C1 both 
/catalyze &omega:-hydroxylation of fatty acids. However they displayed distinct substrate specificities. 
/While, CYP86A8 was capable hydroxylate palmitate and stearate, but not expoxy fatty acids|CITS: [11493698]|, 
/CYP94C1 more effectively metabolized the latter|CITS: [17868380]|. A CYP P450 activity detected in soybean 
/also had preference towards fatty acid epoxides|CITS: [BLEE93]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/2-Oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives in an irreversible reaction.  Five members of this family are known at present, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, the branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, the glycine dehydrogenase complex, and the acetoin dehydrogenase complex.  The 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure.  They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/
/Plants have two forms of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, one in the plastid and the other in the mitochondrion.  The two complexes have distinct physiological roles. The plastid pyruvate dehydrogenase complex provides the main acetyl-CoA source for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME:PWY-4381|). The mitochondrial complex provides acetyl-CoA for the |FRAME:PWY-5690| cycle and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. Both complexes are feedback inhibited by acetyl-CoA and NADH. However the two complexes differ in other aspects of enzyme characteristics.  The mitochondrial complex but not the plastid one is regulated by phosphorylation. The plastid complex requires higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and more alkaline pH for maximal enzyme activity |CITS: [12631264]|.
/
/There are seven genes in the Arabidopsis genome encode for the plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. At1g01090 encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) alpha subunit, AT2g34590 and At1g30120 for the E1 beta subunit, At3g25860 and At1g34430 for the lipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) subunit, and At4g16155 and At3g16950 for the lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) subunit|CITS: [18616834]|.
/
/The reactions catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex  can be summarized by the reaction |FRAME: PYRUVDEH-RXN|.

COMMENT - Although beta-oxidation is the major route for fatty acid degradation, fatty acids can also be subject to alpha- and 
/omega-oxidation. In alpha-oxidation, a fatty acid is oxidized at the alpha-position (C-2) to give rise to a 
/2-hydroperoxy fatty acid. 2-hydroperoxy fatty acids are chemically unstable and are quickly converted to 
/chain-shortened (by one carbon) fatty aldehydes through decarboxylation, or to 2-hydroxy fatty acids. The 
/chain-shortened fatty aldehydes are further oxidized to free fatty acids which can enter the next round of 
/alpha-oxidation.
/The conversion of the intermediate 2(R)-hydroperoxy fatty acids to 2(R)-hydroxy fatty acids may be spontaneous 
/or catalyzed by a peroxidase|CITS: [12432929]|. The 70 kDa subunit of pea alpha-dioxygenase was shown possess such a peroxidase 
/activity|CITS: [10938370]|. Similarly, the conversion of the chain-shortened aldehydes to corresponding fatty acids may be spontaneous or 
/catalyzed by a NAD+ oxidoreductase. The 50 kDa subunit of pea alpha-dioxygenase was shown to have an aldehyde 
/dehydrogenase activity with NAD+. Both polysaturated and unsaturated fatty acids are effective substrates in the pathway. Among the 
/tested ones are laurate, palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate, and arachidonate.
/
/
/In animal and human, alpha-oxidation is important to degrade beta-methyl branched fatty acids 
/which cannot be degraded through beta-oxidation. The physiological role of fatty acid alpha-oxidation in plants is 
/not clear despite of its expected role in chlorophyll / phytol degradation. It has been suggested that the pathway may be 
/related to seed germination (in the case of pea where alpha-dioxygenase is induced only during seed 
/germination|CITS: [10938370]|) and plant response to wounding and plant-pathogen interactions (in the case 
/of tobacco and Arabidopsis where alpha-dioxygenase is induced upon pathogen 
/attack|CITS: [14522973]||CITS: [12060227]|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Glucosyltransferases as one subclass of glycosyltransferases are involved in the glucosylation 
/of a broad variety of secondary plant metabolites, amongst them monolignols involved in the metabolic sequence of lignin 
/biosynthesis |CITS: [Ibrahim77]| |CITS: [Foerster99]|. Modifying enzymes such as the multigene family of glucosyltransferases 
/contribute to the plasticity of metabolism where corresponding products are either involved in a particular biosynthetic route 
/or may act as gateways into different metabolic pathways |CITS: [11042211]| |CITS: [10973093]|.
/
/The presence and significance to lignification of glucosylated cinnamyl alcohols in the cambium of woody plants were emphasized 
/several decades ago by Freudenberg |CITS: [Freudenberg63]| |CITS: [5593877]|. Although 
/glucosyltransferases in general may cover a broad substrate spectrum it has been demonstrated that certain  glucosyltransferases 
/exhibit a rather strict specificity towards their substrates |CITS: [4731963]| |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [15907484]|.
/
/Extensive research has revised the view about how the metabolic sequence for lignin formation proceeds in plants. It appears 
/that the interconversion of lignin precursors may occur at varied points along the lignification pathway, along a preferred 
/metabolic route, but most probably not at the phenylpropanoid acid stage |CITS: [11960740]| |CITS: [14503002]|. Furthermore, 
/the ratio of guaiacyl to syringyl units can be modified at the level of CoA esters |CITS: [GRIMMIG99]|, cinnamyl aldehydes 
/|CITS: [10430877]|, cinnamyl alcohols |CITS: [14709025]| and monolignol glucosides |CITS: [MATSUI96]|. However, it is 
/still a matter of debate whether and to what extent monomeric alcohol and aldehyde glucosides are involved in the <i>in vivo</i> 
/lignin biosynthesis |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [15986215]| and more research is needed to address this issue.
/
/The CAGT activity obtained from seasonal harvests of cambium and developing xylem appeared synchronously with resumption 
/of cambial cell-division activity and is, as its product coniferin, completely undetectable in dormant tissues |CITS: [Savidge98]| 
/|CITS: [Foerster99]|. This link between cambial and enzymatic activity still remains to be demonstrated for the enzymatic 
/counterpart of this pathway, the coniferin specific &beta;-glucosidase |CITS: [7765617]|  |CITS: [7724669]| |CITS: [10412914]| 
/which liberates the aglycones and makes them available for the final assembly of lignin. The turnover of coniferin in pine 
/seedlings has been measured with a half life in the order of 60 to 120 hr, but a quantitative correlation between coniferin 
/turnover and lignification could not be established |CITS: [27355]|.
/
/Coniferin accumulation appears to be under hormonal control. The metabolization of exogenous coniferin in dependence 
/on hormone supplements has been demonstrated in cell cultures of <i>Pinus strobus</i> cambium |CITS: [Savidge89]|. A combination 
/of auxin-cytokinin in the media quickly abolished exogenous applied coniferin whereas the control experiment 
/(auxin and cytokinin alone) had no such effect. It was discussed that a defined ratio of auxin to cytokinin promotes 
/coniferin hydrolysis as demonstrated in various plant tissues |CITS: [HOSEL82]| and that the varying ratio of this plant 
/hormones throughout the cambial region may be the regulative principle for the observed spatial and temporal phenomenon 
/of accumulation or disappearance of coniferin |CITS: [Savidge89]|. Proof for the significance of exogenous and 
/endogenous signals on the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and their derivatives is also the recently published 
/accumulation of coniferin and syringin upon light induction in roots of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [15144378]|. 
/The reported coniferin accumulation is the result of a high-irradiance response (HIR) demonstrating the involvement 
/of primary photoreceptors such as phytochrome and cryptochrome.  
/
/<b>About the pathway:</b> The most prominent monolignol glucoside accumulating in a variety of plants is the 
/4-O-&beta;-D-glucopyranoside of <i>trans</i>-coniferyl alcohol, i.e. coniferin. The enzyme catalyzing the formation of 
/coniferin has been purified from different plant sources |CITS: [10853]| and appears to be most active in developing 
/xylem of gymnosperms |CITS: [6210530]| |CITS: [11430981]|.
/
/The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) also glucosylates sinapyl alcohol with high efficiency in pine

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose.  This oxidation is coupled with NADPH synthesis.  The pathway has two primary reaction sequences: the |FRAME:OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY| and the |FRAME:NONOXIPENT-PWY|.  In the former, |FRAME:GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME:RIBULOSE-5P|; this step is the source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions in the shape of |FRAME:NADPH|.  The subsequent non-oxidative portion (the branch represented here) represents a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, in which |FRAME:RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME:GAP|.  As a result this pathway is a source of reducing power and is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses |CITS:[Zubay83]|.
/
/This pathway is usually understood to be cytosolic.  However, it was shown in spinach that the complete set of pentose phosphate pathway enzymes could be found in the chloroplasts of leaf cells, whereas only enzymes covering the first two steps of the pathway could be found in the cytosol |CITS:[12228497]|.
/
/Additional information on the pathway and its enzymatic regulation can be found in |CITS:[BROWNLEADER97]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The formation of the free hydroxycinnamic acids such as caffeate, ferulate and 
/sinapate has long been thought to derive through a series of hydroxylation and methylation reactions at the 
/phenolic ring of cinnamic acid (|FRAME:PWY-2181|) |CITS: [BAUCHER98]|. However, intensive research 
/directed towards the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids has led to a significant change of the layout and 
/interconnectivity of this central pathway (|FRAME:PWY-361|) giving rise to the biosynthesis of a vast variety 
/of major secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, lignins, lignans, stilbenes and aurones |CITS: [LEWIS99]| 
/|CITS: [11960740]| |CITS: [14503002]|. 
/
/The discovery of new enzymes involved in the metabolic sequence of phenyplpropanoids caused the revision 
/of the pathway generating ferulate and sinapate (this pathway) which constitute precursors for e.g. hydroxycinnamic 
/esters (|FRAME:PWY-3301|) the main secondary metabolites found in the mustard family |CITS: [8972602]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The main stream in the phenylpropanoid pathway  has been demonstrated to 
/lead from p-coumarate to the various monolignols via coumaroyl-CoA and coniferyl aldehyde as the main 
/branching intermediates (|FRAME:PWY-361|). The phenylpropanoid 3-hydroxylation resulting in the formation 
/of 3,4-hydroxylated phenylpropanoids and their further metabolization has been shown to involve 
/hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters as substrates |CITS: [11429408]| |CITS: [11967091]| |CITS: [12381722]| 
/|CITS: [15161961]| whereas 5-hydroxylation and 5-methylation occur on the level of hydroxycinnamaldehydes 
/and/or hydroxycinnamyl alcohols |CITS: [10468559]| |CITS: [10430877]|.
/
/The formation of the free phenylpropanoid acids ferulate and sinapate is catalyzed via the oxidation of the 
/corresponding cinnamaldehydes as proposed earlier |CITS: [10468559]|. The gene (REF1) encoding the 
/enzyme catalyzing the reaction, i.e. cinnamaldehyde dehydrogenase was characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/|CITS: [14729911]| and shown to possess both coniferyl aldehyde- and sinapyl aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. 
/This enzymatic activity has been found earlier in bacteria where coniferyl aldehyde was converted to ferulate 
/|CITS: [9721273]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Several Actinobacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1911|, |FRAME: TAX-67377|, |FRAME: TAX-1704| and |FRAME: TAX-1665| can utilize |FRAME: ARG| as the sole source for carbon and nitrogen utilizing a pathway that involves the intermediate |FRAME:4-GUANIDO-BUTYRAMIDE| |CITS: [Thoai62b][Thoai62a][Yorifuji89][7766193]|. The same pathway was also observed in the eukaryotic parasite |FRAME: TAX-5661| |CITS: [3600696]|.
/
/In this pathway |FRAME: ARG| is degraded via |FRAME:4-GUANIDO-BUTYRAMIDE|, |FRAME: CPD-592|, and |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|, which is eventually degraded via |FRAME: SUCC-S-ALD| into |FRAME: SUC|, and fed into the |FRAME: TCA| (see the pathway |FRAME: 4AMINOBUTMETAB-PWY|) |CITS: [13373855][5936244]|.
/|FRAME: AMMONIA| and |FRAME: UREA| are produced during this process, providing the direct nitrogen source for the organism (urea can be used after it is split by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-6897| into |FRAME: AMMONIA| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|).
/
/The enzymes involved, |FRAME: MONOMER-11564|, |FRAME: MONOMER-11565|, and |FRAME: MONOMER-11566|, were shown to be induced by |FRAME: ARG| added to the culture medium.
/
/A commercial process has been developed to produce |FRAME: MONOMER-11564| from |FRAME: TAX-1911| in 20 and 200 liter tank fermentors |CITS: [Delcambe65]|.
/
/There is also evidence that this pathway can occur in citrus trees (|FRAME: TAX-55188|) |CITS: [Kato86]|, and the intermediate compounds have been found in several other plant species |CITS: [Kato86a]|.

COMMON-NAME - L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 21917546:EV-EXP-IDA-RADIO:3526264554:dreher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Plants produce a number of non-standard amino acids that are not incorporated into proteins, including  |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| |CITS: [11354600][12720365][21917546]|. Although some of these amino acids participate in primary metabolism, others may play a role in plant defense by directly causing harm to the attacking pathogen or herbivore or by making nitrogen less available to it (see refs in |CITS: [21917546]|). Elevated levels of |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| are produced in response to attack by several different insects, as well as the volatile phytohormone |FRAME: Methyl-Jasmonates methyl jasmonate| (MeJA) in Arabidopsis, and this compound can be detected in phloem exudates. |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| appears to act as a defense compound against phloem-feeding herbivores in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| where its effects may be both direct and indirect |CITS: [21917546]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| has been detected in a number of different plants, including 25 ecotypes of |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col|. Within its larger taxonomic family, the |FRAME:TAX-3700 <i>Brassicaceae</i>|, this compound was also detected in <i>Arabidopsis shokei</i>, <i>Arabidopsis suecica</i>,  <i>Capsella rubella</i> and <i>Boechera stricta</i> but it was not found in at least nine other related species that were tested including <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, <i>Camelina sativa</i>, and
/<i>Thellungiella salsuginea</i> |CITS: [21917546]|. However, |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| has been reported to exist in a number of other non-Brassicaceae plant species including <i>Corydalis ochotensis</i>, <i>Asplenium
/nidus</i>, <i>Bistorta bistortoides</i> and in the seeds of legumes such as <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, but its presence in other species, including several grasses, remains controversial |CITS: [11809451][LIPSON96][21917546]|. Outside of plants, |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| has been detected in mushrooms and in sea cucumber, but it is unclear how this non-standard amino acid is produced in these organisms |CITS: [FINDLAY84][OGAWA87]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/ |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| can be produced from at least three different amino acids, namely, proline, arginine, and glutamate, based on radiotracer studies. It is likely that these are first transformed into the non-standard amino acid |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE L-ornithine| before they are acetylated by NATA1 |CITS: [21917546]|. 
/
/Up-regulation of the flux through this pathway in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| appears to be regulated, at least in part, through changes in NATA1 transcript levels since stimuli such as MeJA and insect herbivory appear to cause increased levels of NATA1 expression followed by increased levels of |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine|. There is evidence that |FRAME: CPD-13644 L-<i>N<sup>&delta;</sup></i>-acetylornithine| must also be broken down in Arabidopsis, but the catabolic pathway has not been uncovered to date |CITS: [21917546]|.

COMMENT - Asparagine is the first amino acid discovered in plants. It is the major nitrogen transport and storage compound. In 
/plants, asparagine is further metabolized in two routes, via asparaginase (see |FRAME: ASPARAGINE-DEG1-PWY|) or asparagine 
/aminotransferase (see |FRAME: PWY-4002|). Studies in 
/pea suggested that the predominant route differs in different tissues. The asparaginase pathway predominates in 
/seeds, whereas the aminotransferase pathway predominates in leaves|CITS: [Ireland81]|.
/
/In the asparaginase pathway, as depicted here, asparagine is deaminated to release aspartate and ammonia. The 
/liberated ammonia is reassimilated and utilized in synthesis of all nitrogen-containing-compounds of the cell and in 
/particular the amino acids. In plants, there is no evidence that the other product aspartate is further metabolized to 
/phosphoenolpyruvate as depicted in the MetaCyc human pathway (|FRAME: ASPARAGINE-DEG1-PWY|).

/Translocation of |FRAME: CPD-1099| and |FRAME: CPD-170| is pronounced in members of the |FRAME: TAX-3650| family. One of the photosynthetic products in |FRAME: TAX-3650| is translocated as |FRAME: CPD-1099| and |FRAME: CPD-170| |CITS: [12943544]|. Galactose metabolism in fruits is poorly understood as compared to sucrose metabolism, |FRAME: TAX-3650| plants are excellent models to elucidate the various pathways of galactose metabolism, particularly those involved in fruit ripening |CITS: [16829585]|.
/
/This pathway describes the degradation of |FRAME: CPD-170| and |FRAME: CPD-1099| and recruitment of |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| into the fruit sink where a series of enzymes phosphorylate them. Free galactose is not present in the sink tissues.
/
/The |FRAME: CPD-1099| and |FRAME: CPD-170| oligosaccharides are first subjected to &alpha;-galactosidase activity, which release free galactose into the sink tissue. The pathway begins by the hydrolytic removal of |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| and is translocated into the fruit sink |CITS: [16662141]|.

COMMENT - Plants have evolved to capture available carbon and nitrogen and to maintain the balance of the two to meet 
/different needs of cells for carbon and nitrogen compounds. The ammonia assimilation cycle, involving glutamine 
/synthetase and glutamate synthase, and the glutamate dehydrogenase shunt (GDH shunt) play important roles 
/in the maintenance of carbon and nitrogen balance. The former stores extra nitrogen in the form of glutamate, the 
/latter returns carbons in the amino acid back to carbon metabolism. Under severe carbon shortage conditions, 
/glutamate is converted to 2-oxoglutarate via the GDH shunt. 2-oxoglutarate then enters the TCA cycle and 
/carbon metabolism. Plants lacking the capability of operating the GDH shunt, such as the glutamate dehydrogenase 
/null mutants, have inhibited growth, especially under stress when carbon metabolism is in intense demand|CITS: [8643469]|. The 
/GDH shunt is also thought to provide a means in maintaining the internal glutamate concentration which was shown 
/remarkably constant in Arabidopsis leaves. The only enzyme involved in the GDH shunt, glutamate dehydrogenase, 
/is NADH-dependent and is located in the mitochondria.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC - this pathway), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine.
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway illustrated here presents the reactions catalyzed by the |FRAME:2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX|, a key enzyme of the |FRAME: TCA|. These reactions can be summarized by the general reaction
/
/|FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-RXN|

COMMENT - Cardiolipin is an anionic membrane phospholipid. It is present in the plasma membrane of bacteria, 
/whilst, is a marker lipid of mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes. Along with phosphatidylglycerol, the 
/anionic lipids are important for the biogenesis and function of the mitochondrial membrane. 
/
/The difference of cardiolipin biosynthesis between bacteria and eukaryotes lies in the last step. 
/Whereas in bacteria, two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol are condensed to form cardiolipin, in 
/eukaryotes, cardiolipin is formed from one molecule of CDP-diacylglycerol and one molecule of 
/phosphatidylglycerol. In all eukaryotes, cardiolipin biosynthesis occurs in the inner mitochondrial 
/membrane|CITS: [15811335]|. In mung bean mitochondria, the phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) 
/phosphatase activity is much higher than the PGP synthase activity, results in a quick turn over of 
/phosphatidylglycerolphosphate to phosphatidylglycerol|CITS: [12232283]|. In fact, 
/phosphatidylglycerolphosphate is not detected in mitochondrial membranes of mung beans. It is 
/noteworthy that, in addition to be synthesized in mitochondria, phosphatidylglycerol may also be 
/imported from ER to serve as the cardiolipin precursor pool|CITS: [12609031]|. PGP synthase catalyzes the 
/rate-limiting step of cardiolipin biosynthesis.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group 
/found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. It is a porphyrin 
/member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles and biosynthesized as protoheme. Siroheme is an iron-containing 
/isobacteriochlorin, and constitutes a modified tetrapyrrole similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll. 
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Siroheme biosynthesis starts by the same route as other tetrapyrroles, 
/i.e. |FRAME:GLT| and branches out on the intermediate |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|. 
/Methylation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| directs it toward siroheme biosynthesis, a heme-like 
/prosthetic group that is found in only two but indispensable plant enzymes, sulfite and nitrite reductases 
/|CITS: [9006913]|. On the other side decarboxylation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| results in 
/|FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II| |CITS: [17416636]|.
/
/A second branch point at |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| leads to heme biosynthesis. Two enzymes 
/at that branchpoint, i.e. ferrochelatase |CITS: [17416636]| and Mg-chelatase |CITS: [Walker97]| decide 
/whether protoporphyrin IX is channeled towards Mg-containing chlorophyllides or Fe-containing hemes.
/
/Two more enzymes involved in the heme biosynthesis have been characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/so far. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, which forms protoporphyrinogen IX by oxidative decarboxylation 
/|CITS: [Santana02]| and protoporphyrinogen oxidase generating protoporphyrin IX the aforementioned 
/branchpoint compound of the pathway |CITS: [8982084]|.
/
/For siroheme synthesis, methylation occurs at positions 2 and 7, forming dihydrosirohydrochlorin (also 
/known as precorrin-2) |CITS: [8953249]| |CITS: [9006913]|.
/
/The second step of the three step pathway to siroheme, the oxidation of precorrin-2 to sirohydrochlorin is 
/catalyzed by precorrin-2 dehydrogenase, an enzyme that has not yet been characterized in plants. The 
/final step, the chalation of ferrous iron to sirohydrochlorin forming siroheme is catalyzed by sirohydrochlorin 
/ferrochelatase possessing an integral Fe-S center which has been discussed as indication to the close 
/association with the metabolism of sulfur and iron |CITS: [15545265]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Even at low concentrations, free galactose and its derivatives are toxic to plants |CITS:[ORDIN57]|. This has been shown to be due to the inhibition of incorporation of glucose into cellulose, which in turns results in an inhibition of elongation of growth. However the molecular basis galactose toxicity is unclear. Feeding inhibitory concentrations of external galactose to intact roots is linked to an increase in galactose-1-phosphate but a decrease of UDP-galactose. It was shown that galactose-1-phosphate can act as a competitive inhibitor of UTP:glucose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase thereby inhibiting the formation of UDP-glucose, a precursor of cellulose biosynthesis (note that it was subsequently argued that the concentration of galactose-1-phosphate used in the experiment is unlikely to be physiological |CITS:[9225860]|. Other studies using galactose-resistant cell lines offered UDP-galactose as the main toxic metabolite (resistant lines were characterized by increased levels of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase) |CITS:[MARETZKI78]|. Irrespective of the exact mode of toxicity, plants must exercise a tight control over the levels of free galactose and its phosphorylated derivatives. Although galactose degradation is often understood to occur via the transfer of the UDP moiety of UDP-glucose to galactose-1-phosphate to form UDP-galactose (Leloir pathway, see |FRAME:GALACTMETAB-PWY|), the degradation of galactose has also been shown in plants to occur via the conversion of galactose-1-phosphate to UDP-galactose by an uridyltransferase using UTP as uridine diphosphate source. The uridylation of galactose-1-phosphate is followed by the epimerization of UDP-galactose into UDP-glucose which is thought to play a central role as 'branch point' metabolite (formation of glucose-1-phosphate for energy needs, synthesis of transportable sucrose, or cell-wall synthesis in developing seedlings).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Glutamate is biosynthesized in the mitochondrion from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate
/&alpha;-ketoglutarate.  As shown in this pathway, glutamate dehydrogenase NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> produces
/glutamate by reductive amination of &alpha;-ketoglutarate with ammonia.  Glutamate is a precursor of proline,
/ornithine, arginine and glutamine |CITS: [SALWAY04] [VOET04]|.
/
/Other reactions of glutamate biosynthesis are also found.  In bacteria, glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate
/synthase are both involved in ammonia assimilation. Glutamate synthase (NADPH)
/(see pathway |FRAME: GLUTSYN-PWY|) is widespread in bacteria and is utilized at low concentrations of
/ammonia.  Glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP<sup>+</sup>) (see pathway |FRAME: GLUTSYNIII-PWY|) does
/not appear to operate when ammonia is scarce |CITS: [GOTTSCHALK1986]|.  In fungi and plants, glutamate
/synthase (NADH) is also involved in ammonia assimilation (see pathway |FRAME: GLUGLNSYN-PWY|).  Plants
/and cyanobacteria |CITS: [10898944]| can use a ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (see

/The active form of thiamin is |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|. The non-phosphorylated form |FRAME: THIAMINE| is not produced as an intermediate in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic route in bacteria, but is found in the environment as a degradation product.

/Many microbes possess transporters that allow them to import thiamin |CITS: [16291685]|, as well as salvage pathways that regenerate the active form.

/This single-step thiamin salvage pathway was originally thought to occur only in eukaryotes, but the discovery of the enzyme in |FRAME: TAX-1423| revealed that it is also used by bacteria.

/Chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoyl-D-quinic acid) is one of the most widespread hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in the plant kingdom. Their physiological roles include defense, disease resistance and role in growth regulation |CITS: [2821918]|.

/only one enzyme species which is responsible for the hydroxylation of the 5-O-(4-coumaric) esters of both D-quinate and shikimate. The activity of this enzyme is greatly increased by in vivo irradiation of the cells with blue/uv light. Biosynthesis of the predominant caffeic acid conjugates in carrot |FRAME: TAX-4039| cells occurs via the corresponding 4-coumaric acid esters. Thus, in this system, 5-O-(4-coumaroyl)-D-quinate can be seen as the final intermediate in the chlorogenic acid pathway.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are produced by many plants, bacteria and marine algae in response to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity and hypoxia. Most members of the highly stress-tolerant plant family Plumbaginaceae accumulate &beta;-alanine betaine as osmoprotectant. Its potential role in plant tolerance to salinity and hypoxia makes it an interesting target for metabolic engineering. The utilization of another QAC: |FRAME:BETAINE|, was attempted which failed to achieve the expected stress-tolerance in transgenic plants due to the limited availability of the substrate choline required for glycine betaine synthesis. Unlike glycine betaine, &beta;-alanine does not require choline or oxygen for its biosynthesis, and has therefore been suggested to be a better osmoprotectant under saline and hypoxic conditions |CITS:[hanson00],[rathina00]|.
/
/<b>Enzymes:</b> The &beta;-alanine betaine biosynthesis pathway in |FRAME:TAX-227291| requires three rounds of <i>N</i>-methylation, each of which is performed by the same N-methyltransferase encoded by the <i>BANMT1</i> gene. The enzyme converts each methyl acceptor (&beta;-alanine, N-methyl-&beta;-alanine and N,N-dimethyl-&beta;-alanine) with similar catalytic efficiency |CITS:[11457974]|.

COMMENT - In plants, degradation of fatty acids having cis-double bonds on even-numbered carbons such as linoleic 
/acid and linolenic acid, the two prevalent fatty acids in lipid storage tissues, proceeds via two alternative 
/routes. Fatty acids first enter the core beta-oxidation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5136|). The intermediate 
/2,4-dienoyl-CoA may then enter the so called reductase/isomerase pathway which involves 
/2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and &delta;3-&delta;2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, and converts the dienoyl-CoA 
/to trans-2-enoyl-CoA. Trans-2-enoyl-CoA returns to the core beta-oxidation pathway for further 
/degradation.  Alternatively, dienoyl-CoA is converted to cis-2-enoyl-CoA through one more cycle of 
/core beta-oxidation pathway. Cis-2-enoyl-CoA cannot be completely degraded via the core beta-oxidation 
/pathway since hydratation of cis-2-enoyl-CoA yields D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA which is not a substrate 
/for 3-hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Cis-2-enoyl-CoA needs enter the so called epimerase pathway 
/which involves converting D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA by 3-hydroxylacyl-CoA 
/epimerase or by two stereo-specific enoyl-CoA hydratases. L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA then returns to the 
/core beta-oxidation pathway |CITS: [11755682]|. Studies in cucumber cotyledon suggested the epimerase pathway is much more effective than the reductase/isomerase pathway|CITS: [1879422]|. Whereas, studies in Aarbidopsis 
/indicated both pathways contribute significantly to fatty acid degradation|CITS: [11080293]|. The 
/delta-3, delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase and 3-hydroxylacyl-CoA epimerase activities, together with two 
/enzyme activities also found in the core beta-oxidation pathway, namely 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase I 
/(L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase) and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, are attributed to a single 
/multifunctional protein (MFP, see the experimentally characterized MFPs in the corresponding MetaCyc pathway).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is a crucial compound involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of terpenoids including sesquiterpenoids and sterols.  Moreover, FPP is also used in posttranslational modifications of proteins (farnesylation) which is believed to act as a membrane attachment device.  The biosynthesis of FPP is largely thought to occur in the cytosol where sesquiterpenoids and sterols are produced.  This cytosolic FPP is synthesized from the condensation of DMAPP (dimethylallyl pyrophosphate) and two molecules of IPP (isopentenyl pyrophosphate) originating from the |FRAME:PWY-922| |CITS:[16179482],[11289612]|.  However, FPP is also found in other plant organelles (plastids and mitochondria |CITS:[14630967],[16179482]|) where IPP and DMAPP may also originate from the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY| instead of the mevalonate pathway.  The synthesis of FPP is the result of two head-to-tail condensation reactions: first GPP (geranyl pyrophosphate) is formed from the condensation of DMAPP and IPP; another IPP molecule is then added to form FPP.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-7672 3-Methylthiopropanoate| is produced by several routes: (i)  catabolism of methionine |CITS:[479166]|, (ii) demethylation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate in bacteria |CITS:[8899985]| or (iii) a shunt route of the |FRAME:PWY-5389|.
/
/In the latter route, represented here, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene is oxidized to formate and 3-methylthioproprionate. The purpose of this shunt route, also known as the off-pathway reaction of methionine salvage, is yet unknown; it has been postulated that it might provide a mechanism for regulating methionine levels in vivo |CITS: [11371200]|.
/
/The enzyme responsible for the formation of |FRAME:CPD-7672| is acireductone dioxygenase.  This enzyme has been found in a number of species and has been shown to be involved in the catalysis of two reactions: the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-dependent conversion of |FRAME:CPD-85| into |FRAME:CPD-479| (EC 1.13.11.53) and the Ni<sup>2+</sup>-dependent conversion of the same substrate into |FRAME:CPD-7672| (EC 1.13.11.54) |CITS:[16989860]|.  This enzyme has been characterized for |FRAME:TAX-573| (see |FRAME:MONOMER-1323|) and in rice.  The latter was shown to catalyze mostly the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-acireductone dioxygenase step.  Indeed, this enzyme appears to have a preference for Fe<sup>2+</sup> rather than Ni<sup>2+</sup> suggesting it might be involved mostly in the |FRAME:PWY-4361| rather than the shunt pathway producing the cytotoxic compound 3-<i>S</i>-methylthiopropionate |CITS:[16297065]|.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>
/
/In plants, the production of 3-methylthiopropionate remains uncertain. The compound is cytotoxic to plant cells and has been reported in leaves of cassava infected by |FRAME:TAX-339| as a blight-inducing toxin |CITS:[perreaux86]|.  It is known to be produced by phytopathogens and by soil microorganisms, and to affect the growth of plant seedlings |CITS:[12715879]|.

COMMENT - Vitamin E refers to a collection of tocopherols including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols which 
/differ only in the number and position of methyl groups on the chromanol ring. Tocopherols are essential dietary 
/components for humans and animals and act primarily as antioxidants. As for plants, they are proposed to be 
/involved in the protection of chloroplast lipids and chlorophylls against oxidative damages. Alpha-tocopherol has 
/been shown with the highest vitamin E activity. Tocopherols are synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms. 
/Genes of all the pathway enzymes have been cloned from Arabidopsis.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are beta-thio-glucosides. They are found prominently in the order Capparales, which includes cabbage, 
/mustard, oilseed rape, broccoli, and the model plant Arabidopsis. In addition to be responsible for the typical sharp taste and 
/odor of many glucosinolate-producing plants, glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. In plant herbivore 
/defense, upon insect chewing on the plant tissues, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed and broken down to toxic compounds 
/by the myrosinase (beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) system. In this process, bioactive isothiocyanate, simple nitrile 
/and epithionitrile are produced from aliphatic glucosinolates, whereas, only isothiocyante and simple nitrile are produced 
/from indole glucosinolates |CITS: [18346197]|. Additionally, indole glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed in vivo in living plant 
/cells by the specific myrosinase PEN2-dependent pathway. The hydrolysis products in the PEN2- pathway are different 
/from the insect chewing induced indole glucosinolate degradation |FRAME: PWYQT-4476|, and are found bioactive in broad-spectrum antifungal 
/defense |CITS: [19095900]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Since the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| is a very complex process, many organisms possess various salvage pathways thart enable them to rescue thiamin fragments obtained from the environment. This pathway describes the salvage of two thiamin-degradation compounds, |FRAME: THZ| and |FRAME: HMP| (HMP).
/
/The key enzyme of the pathway is |FRAME: CPLX-8351| (|FRAME: BSU38300|), an enzyme  that phosphorylates the degradation product |FRAME: THZ|, turning it into the phosphorylated form that it a part of the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway.
/
/HMP is processed by |FRAME: BSU11710-MONOMER| (|FRAME: BSU11710|), a bifunctional enzyme that also takes part in the biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme phosphorylates HMP into |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYL-PYR-P|, already an intermediate of the biosynthetic pathway, and continues to add another phosphate, resulting in |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|, the other substrate of |FRAME: BSU38290-MONOMER|.
/
/The rest of the pathway is identical to the biosynthetic pathway: |FRAME: BSU38290-MONOMER| catalyzes the coupling of the thiazole and pyrimidine moieties, while |FRAME: BSU05900-MONOMER| adds another phosphate group, generating the active form |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales,
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family.
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard.
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different glucosinolates,
/of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine (range from homomethionine
/to hexahomomethionine). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.
/
/The depicted pathway only illustrates one example of methionine-derived glucosinolates, specifically
/homomethione-derived (example here is a C3 glucosinolate; C3 referring to the number of methylene groups
/in the side chain). It should be noted that chain-elongated methiones are converted to their corresponding
/glucosinolates in a similar fashion.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Elemental-selenium Selenium| is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but has not yet been proven to be an essential micronutrient for land plants |CITS: [11683552][16307305]|. There is evidence, however, of Chlamydomonas proteins that contains a |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE selenocysteine| residue suggesting that algal species might also require |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| |CITS: [17105189][12110581]|. The health requirement of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| for humans and animals can be met by crops and forage plants that contain selenocompounds. |FRAME: TAX-4232 <i>Helianthus annuus</i>| among the oilseed crops was shown to be a good source for this micronutrient |CITS: [15012198]|. Despite its importance as a micronutrient, higher concentrations of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| are toxic to humans, other animals, and plants largely because transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur and sulfo-compound metabolism can often erroneously substitute |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| for sulfur and can misincorporate seleno-amino acids into proteins |CITS: [21913064][12753978][16661781]|.
/
/In general, plants take up both |FRAME: SELENATE selenate| and |FRAME: SELENITE selenite| from soil. A series of reduction steps converts |FRAME: SELENATE selenate| to |FRAME: SE-2 selenide| / |FRAME: CPD-678 hydrogen selenide| and this is assimilated into the seleno-amino acids |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE selenocysteine| and |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE selenomethionine| |CITS: [19309459]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In many plant species the metabolism of selenium appears to mirror the metabolism of sulfur and often uses the same enzymes. Therefore, although this pathway has not been completely elucidated in plants, it has been built based on the comparable |FRAME: SULFMETII-PWY reductive sulfur assimilation pathway| found in plants |CITS: [16307305]|.
/
/As in the sulfur reduction pathway, the ATP sulfurylase enzyme appears to catalyze the first step in selenium reduction. This claim is supported by the finding that overexpression of an Arabiopsis ATP sulfurylase promotes selenate reduction |CITS: [9880353][15941393]|.
/
/The second step in the pathway is still being investigated. There is evidence for non-enzymatic conversion of |FRAME: CPD-13713 adenosine 5'-phosphoselenate| to selenite <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [328009]|, but selenite reductase activity has been observed <i>in planta</i> and has been measured in a number of selenium hyperaccumulators |CITS: [15941393]|.
/
/The latter part of the pathway is believed to differ from the parallel sulfur pathway. To date, there is no evidence that a sulfite reductase enzyme is needed to catalyze the transformation of |FRAME: SELENITE selenite| to |FRAME: CPD-678 hydrogen selenide| in plants. Rather, evidence collected using pea chloroplasts suggests that this reaction can proceed non-enzymatically and uses both glutathione and NADPH as reducing agents |CITS: [JABLONSKI82]|. Expected intermediates are |FRAME: CPD-13909 glutathioselenol| and |FRAME: CPD-13909 glutathioselenol|.
/
/Analyses of the overall reduction of selenate to organic selenium suggest that the first step of selenate reduction is rate-limiting |CITS: [9701603]|. 
/
/This pathway is believed to occur in the choloroplast |CITS: [12753978]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Benzoic acid, derived from phenylalanine, is a precuror to several important benzenoid compounds, including floral scent constituents, such as |FRAME:CPD-12217|, |FRAME:CPD-6443| |FRAME:CPD-6441| |CITS:[15286288][12884048][12226525][12361714]|; the defense signaling compounds salicylic acid (SA) and its derivatives |CITS:[19400653][19820324]|, and a number of pharmacologically active compounds, such as taxol |CITS: [11095755 ]| (rev in |CITS: [16600669]|).  An important step in the creation of benzoic acid is the cleavage of two carbon atoms from the 3-carbon side-chain present on trans-cinnamic acid. At least three different chain-shortening routes have been proposed in plants |CITS: [15286288]| and there is evidence that a subset of the different pathways may operate in individual species, and may differentially contribute to benzoic acid biosynthesis within each species. For example, |FRAME:TAX-4102| has at least two pathways present (this pathway and |FRAME: PWY-6444|), whereas cucumber (|FRAME:TAX-3659|) and |FRAME:TAX-49451| seem to lack the |FRAME: PWY-6444| variant |CITS: [11219576]| and |FRAME:TAX-140968| relies on a third pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6446|) that incorporates elements of the other two variants. 
/
/A greater understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in benzoic acid biosynthesis may contribute to genetic engineering efforts aimed at altering floral scents, modifying SA-based defense responses, and increasing the production of pharmaceutically important compounds |CITS: [17234289][17511599]|.
/
/Although benzoate biosynthesis has been primarily studied in plants, there is evidence that |FRAME: TAX-115828| bacteria make |FRAME: BENZOYLCOA| using the early steps in the |FRAME: PWY-6443| pathway |CITS: [12502351]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Following the initial activation of trans-cinnamic acid with CoA, the next three steps of this pathway are expected to share similarities with the &beta;-oxidation process involved in |FRAME: PWY-5136 "fatty acid metabolism"|. These reactions,  from |FRAME: CINNAMOYL-COA| to |FRAME: BENZOYLCOA| will likely require the sequential activities of an enoyl-CoA hydratase, a dehydrogenase, and a thiolase |CITS: [15286288]|. 
/
/|FRAME: BENZOYLCOA "Benzoyl-CoA"| can then be used to produce |FRAME: BENZOATE| through at least two different routes. In petunia, the |FRAME: MONOMER-15440 "BPBT"| enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the volatile intermediate |FRAME: CPD-6443| has been characterized |CITS: [17194766][15286288]|.  |FRAME: CPD-6443 "Benzylbenzoate"| can be used to produce |FRAME: BENZOATE| through the activity of an esterase. Alternatively, a thioesterase may perform the conversion from |FRAME: BENZOYLCOA| to |FRAME: BENZOATE| in one step. 
/
/Although many of the enzymes that are predicted to participate in this pathway have not yet been cloned or characterized in plants, radiotracer studies provide strong evidence for some of the early |CITS: [11219576]| and later steps in the pathway |CITS: [11219576][19659733]|. The identification of two enzymes from petunia that work late in the pathway provide additional support |CITS: [15286288][19659733]|.
/
/Given the importance of the many compounds that can be derived from benzoic acid, it is not surprising that the biosynthesis of benzoate is regulated |CITS: [11219576]|, for example, by changes in the level of transcript expression for the BPBT and KAT1 enzymes |CITS: [15286288][19659733]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In plants, the protein levels in seeds influence seed survival in natural settings and help determine the seeds' nutritional value and processing properties when they are grown for human and animal consumption. A large fraction of this protein content may be derived from the remobilization of nitrogen from proteins in senescing leaves |CITS: [11244107][16690166][17244043]|. This nitrogen can be transported in the form of amino acids, prinicipally glutamine, through the phloem. Improving the efficiency of this process could lead to the production of seed-based crops with higher protein levels |CITS: [20202167]|.
/
/One of the enzymes in this pathway, pyruvate, orthodiphosphate dikinase (PPDK), plays a prominent role in photosynthesis in C4 plants such as |FRAME: TAX-4577 <i>Zea mays</i>| (maize), yet it is also expressed in C3 plants, such as |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col|. This pathway may help to explain the physiological function of PPDK in C3 plants |CITS: [20202167]|. Interestingly, in all plant species studied to date, both a cytosolic and a chloroplastic isoform of the PPDK enzyme are generated from alternative promoters upstream of the same chromosomal locus. Over-expression of the cytosolic form of this enzyme in Arabidopsis during senescence can lead to an increase in seed weight and seed nitrogen content indicating that this form of the enzyme may be important for nitrogen remobilization |CITS: [20202167]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Portions of this pathway likely occurs in several subcellular compartments, notably, the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplast. The pyruvate that initally feeds into this pathway may be derived from the deamination of some amino acids, such as threonine, glycine, serine, alanine, and cysteine. 
/
/Starting with pyruvate, after the sequential activities of cytosolic PPDK and PEP carboxylase, the |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID oxaloacetate| (OAA) produced can flow into the |FRAME: PWY-5690 TCA cycle| in the mitochondria where it can be converted to citrate. The citrate may be metabolized in the mitochondria or the cytosol by aconitase. The subsequent transformation of |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE isocitrate| into |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE 2-oxoglutarate| can be catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLXQT-51 NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase| in the mitochondria |CITS: [16527867]| or by |FRAME: AT1G65930-MONOMER NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase| in the cytosol |CITS: [20199623][20202167]|.
/
/In the chloroplast, this |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE 2-oxoglutarate| carbon skeleton can then be transformed into a nitrogen-transporting amino acid by the activities of  glutamate synthase and glutamine synthase. The resulting |FRAME: GLN L-glutamine| can then be exported to seeds through the phloem |CITS: [20202167]|.

CITATIONS - 16496096:EV-EXP:3444508009:peifenz
COMMENT - The ureides allantoin and allantoate are the major nitrogenous compounds synthesized in root nodules of ureide 
/exporting legumes, such as soybean, during nitrogen fixation. Synthesized ureides are transported from root nodules 
/via the xylem to shoots, where they are rapidly degraded. The products of ureide catabolism are re-assimilated and 
/utilized in nitrogen metabolism. 
/
/Allantoin is also produced from |FRAME: PWY-5044| in all plants. Four molecules of ammonium are 
/released from allantoin during its further breakdown, making the nitrogen stored in the ring of the purine bases 
/accessible for anabolic reactions. Purine and allantoin degradation and nitrogen remobilization are important 
/processes during senescence when the great majority of nitrogen stored in the leaves is exported to sustain 
/flowering and seed or storage organ development |CITS:[18065556]|.
/
/There is some uncertainty about the ureide degradation pathway in plants, since several routes are possible. The 
/general scheme of the pathway is the degradation of S-allantoin via allantoate to S-ureidoglycolate , which is 
/degraded further into glyoxylate . However, there are two possible routes leading from allantoate to S-ureidoglycolate, 
/and there are two possible routes from S-ureidoglycolate to glyoxylate : each of these two steps can be performed 
/by enzyme(s) that liberate the nitrogen as either ammonia or urea .
/
/So far, the limited literature information regarding ureide degradation in Arabidopsis only supports the 
/ammonia-producing pathway from allantoate to S-ureidoglycolate.  For a complete picture of allantoin degradation 
/in other plants, see <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org:1555/PLANT/NEW-IMAGE?type=NIL&object=URDEGR-PWY">PlantCyc</A>.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| can biosynthesize |FRAME: GLY| via three different pathways.
/
/When the cells are grown with glucose as the carbon source, two alternative pathways operate. 
/In one pathway |FRAME:ENZRXN-13666|, encoded by |FRAME: G-9836|, produces glycine from
/|FRAME:THR| (which is produced from the glycolytic intermediate oxaloacetate) (see
/|FRAME: GLYSYN-THR-PWY|). In the other pathway glycine is formed from |FRAME:SER| (a product of
/|FRAME: G3P|, another glycolytic intermediate) via two serine hydroxymethyltransferases - a cytosolic
/enzyme (SHMT2) and a mitochondrial enzyme (SHMT1)
/(see |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY|).  The two isoforms are reported to work in opposite directions,
/depending on the culture conditions |CITS: [9398220]|.
/
/When the cells are grown with a non-fermentable carbon source, such as |FRAME:ETOH| and
/|FRAME:ACET|, glycine is produced from |FRAME: GLYOX|, a product of the
/|FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS|, by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-7560| (see
/|FRAME: GLYSYN-ALA-PWY|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME:CPLX-7560| is one of three different enzymes used for glycine synthesis in |FRAME: TAX-4932|. This enzyme is active only during growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and enables |FRAME: TAX-4932| to grow on ethanol as sole carbon source, by alleviating the need for glycolytic intermediates as the precursors for |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [14745783]|.
/
/Alanine--glyoxylate transaminase is widely distributed, and has been documented in archaea, bacteria and eukaryota.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Within their life cycle plants are constantly confronted with the production of reactive oxygen
/species (ROS) generated in several metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. Plants have developed
/a sophisticated defense system including non-enzymatic and highly efficient enzymatic mechanisms to be protected from
/oxidative damage |CITS:[11867229]|. Thiols such as the main thiol and reductant in plants glutathione are involved in the
/detoxification of ROS and related stress factors maintaining the redox balance of the cell
/(see |FRAME:Gamma-Glutamyl-Cycles|).
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: This pathway shows the reduction of various molecules such as peroxides,
/or protein-disulfides that are formed from two molecules of glutathione (GSH) and are condensed into the
/oxidized form of glutathione disulfide (GSSG). The Arabidopsis genome contains a small group of 8 genes
/encoding for glutathione peroxidases (GLX1-8) which have been shown to be expressed in various cell compartments
/|CITS:[14617062]| |CITS:[17096689]|. Amongst those GLX6 has been demonstrated to catalyze the reduction
/of hydroperoxides of phospholipids, hence acting as a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX)
/(EC 1.11.1.12) in both mitochondria and cytosol |CITS:[9511228]| |CITS:[14617062]|. The exact molecular function
/of most of the remaining glutathione peroxidases remain to be experimentally verified, but it has been suggested that
/those isoenzymes may function to detoxify hydrogen peroxide using thioredoxin instead of glutathione |CITS:[17096689]|.
/
/The back reaction from GSSG to GSH is catalyzed by glutathione reductase. The gene encoding this enzyme
/has been identified and characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Genomic southern analysis indicates that
/GR exists as a single copy gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[Kubo93]|.

TYPES - Ascorbate-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - L-ascorbate degradation V
CITATIONS - PMNUPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE|, also known as vitamin C, fulfils multiple essential roles in both plants and animals.
/Being a strong reducing agent, it functions as an antioxidant and a redox buffer. It is also a cofactor for several enzymes, which are involved in many important pathways, including collagen hydroxylation, carnitine biosynthesis, norepinephrine biosynthesis, and hormone and tyrosine metabolism.
/In plants L-ascorbate is also implicated in defense against pathogens and in control of plant growth and development.
/A significant proportion of a plants ascorbate is found in the apoplast (the aqueous solution permeating the cell walls) |CITS: [15608627]|.
/
/Under aerobic conditions L-ascorbate is oxidized in cells to |FRAME: CPD-13907 dehydroascorbate| (via the radical |FRAME: CPD-318|), which can be recycled back to ascorbate by the |FRAME: PWY-2261|. However, once formed, dehydroascorbate can be further broken down <i>in vivo</i> by irreversible reactions, escaping the  |FRAME: PWY-2261|.
/
/Several pathways for the irreversible catabolism of ascorbate have been described. Facultatively aerobic bacteria such as  |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-573| degrade L-ascorbate by different pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME: PWY-6961| and |FRAME: PWY0-301|). The anaerobic pathway begins with phosphorylation of ascorbate (mediated by a PTS-type transporter), while the aerobic pathway proceeds via |FRAME: CPD-334|. Both pathways produce |FRAME: XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE|, a centeral metabolite that is fed into the pentose phosphate pathway |CITS: [18708499]|.
/
/Plants from the |FRAME: TAX-3602| family (e.g. grapes) metabolize ascorbate to |FRAME: TARTRATE| via the intermediates |FRAME: CPD-13059| and |FRAME: L-IDONATE| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6704|). The tartrate skeleton is derived from carbons 1-4 of L-ascorbate, indicating a cleavage between carbons 4 and 5 |CITS: [Loewus99][16567629]|. 
/
/The geraniaceous plant |FRAME: TAX-1417776| metabolizes ascorbate to |FRAME: TARTRATE| and |FRAME: OXALATE| via a different pathway, with |FRAME: L-THREONATE|, rather than L-idonate, as an intermediate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6960|). In this case the tartrate skeleton is derived from carbons 3-6 of L-ascorbate, indicating a cleavage between carbons 2 and 3 |CITS:[Loewus99][15862089]|. Grapes are also known to accumulate |FRAME: OXALATE| |CITS: [DeBolt04]|, and thus may be using both pathways to generate tartrate.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-334| (DKG) is a well established degradation product of |FRAME: L-DEHYDRO-ASCORBATE| (DHA), although the pathway(s) it is involved in are not well characterized.
/A study of ascorbate degradation by human lens homogenates found that under non-oxidative conditions DHA was hydrolyzed to DKG, which was subsequently converted to |FRAME: OXALATE| and |FRAME: ERYTHRULOSE| |CITS: [10727845]|. 
/These findings contradicted an earlier study of L-ascorbate degradation into oxalate in several plants, which found that DKG was a very poor substrate for oxalate production (although it is possible that the pathways differ among plants and animals) |CITS: [16659288]|.
/
/This pathway describes the findings of a careful study that evaluated the different chemical reactions involved in DHA catabolism in the plant apoplast |CITS: [21846329]|. The study determined that DHA is a branch point in ascorbate catabolism - under oxidative conditions it is oxidized to oxalate and its esters (see |FRAME: PWY-6960|), while under non-oxidative conditions it is hydrolyzed to DKG. The oxidation:hydrolysis ratio is determined by the concentration of reactive oxygen species. 
/
/Under non-enzymatic, non-oxidative conditions, DKG was formed slowly and converted to |FRAME: CPD-13913|, which was reversibly de-lactonized to |FRAME: CPD-13912| |CITS: [21846329]|. There was little evidence for enzyme activity in the catabolism of DKG. The presence of either L-ascorbate or hydrogen peroxide supressed the formation of |FRAME: CPD-13913|, suggesting that DKG was diverted under these conditions to competing oxidative pathways.
/
/The fact that the pathway proceeds non-enzymatically suggests that it may occur in the apoplast of most, if not all plants.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This pathway of L-tyrosine degradation has been characterized in mammals, some bacteria, and the fungi
/|FRAME: TAX-162425| and |FRAME: TAX-746128| |CITS: [9734339] [7568087] [15262943][19028908]| and reviewed 
/in |CITS: [15581571]| and |CITS: [11567547]|.  L-Phenylalanine degradation shares this pathway after its initial hydroxylation to L-tyrosine (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PHENYLALANINE-DEG1-PWY|).  |FRAME: TAX-162425|
/also degrades phenylacetate via 2-hydroxyphenylacetate to homogentisate using this pathway |CITS: [7673153]|.
/The pathway ends in intermediates of central metabolism, as indicated by the pathway links.  Deficiencies of 
/enzymes in this pathway have been associated with several human genetic disorders (as indicated in the 
/comments for the individual enzymes in this pathway).  Homogentisate is a central intermediate.  In addition to being 
/further catabolized, it can also be a biosynthetic precursor for melanins (in |CITS: [8071207]|), and is used by higher 
/plants in the biosynthesis of plastoquinone and tocopherols (in |CITS: [15157070]| and reviewed 
/in |CITS: [15581571]|) (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: PWY-1581| and |FRAME: PWY-1422|).   
/
/This pathway does not occur in |FRAME:TAX-562| and |FRAME:TAX-590|, which cannot utilize L-tyrosine 
/as a carbon and energy source (McFall, E. and Newman E. G. in |CITS: [COLISAL]|).  The pathway is also lacking in 
/the yeast |FRAME:TAX-4932| which uses a limited number of carbon sources for growth, but 
/can use most amino acids as sole nitrogen source (in |CITS: [15933030]|) (see MetaCyc pathways 
/|FRAME: ANAPHENOXI-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5079|).      
/
/A variation of this pathway has been reported in some Gram positive bacteria that can degrade L-tyrosine 
/via 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate (homoprotocatechuate), rather than homogentisate, to pyruvate and 
/succinate |CITS: [931949] [20216]|.  Another variation has been shown in the gram positive bacterium |FRAME:TAX-1817| 
/sp. 239 which can degrade L-tyrosine to homogentisate via p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, 
/p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate.  D- and L-phenylalanine were similarly degraded 
/by this organism via the corresponding non-hydroxylated compounds |CITS: [DEBOER88]|.  There is also 
/evidence that the yeast |FRAME:TAX-4952| can degrade tyrosine to homogentisate through these 
/intermediates |CITS: [11472920]|.  Among the archaea, however, there is little information regarding aromatic 
/amino acid degradation, even in the well studied hyperthermophile |FRAME:TAX-2261| 
/(in |CITS: [15803651]|), although a preliminary pathway has been proposed |CITS: [8206994]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:HCN Hydrogen cyanide| is formed in stoichiometrically equal amounts to ethylene as a byproduct of ethylene biosynthesis (see |FRAME:ETHYL-PWY|) during the oxidation of |FRAME:CPD-68| (ACC), the immediate precursor of |FRAME:ETHYLENE-CMPD| |CITS:[16593463]| |CITS:[Grossmann03]|. 
/
/Cyanide is toxic to all living cells and requires rapid detoxification in the plant tissues |CITS: [3073064]| |CITS: [12422245]|. Furthermore, as a defense mechanism, cyanide is also released from cyanogenic glucosides, i.e. cyanogenesis, by cyanogenic plants (see for example |FRAME:PWY-7089|, |FRAME:PWY-7093|). Cyanide is detoxified to |FRAME:CPD-603|, a non-protein amino acid which is wide-spread in higher plants and is neurotoxic to many animals. In most plants, |FRAME:CPD-603| can be further metabolized to |FRAME:ASN| and |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE| (this pathway) |CITS:[11060302]|.
/
/There is also evidence that |FRAME:HCN| plays a regulatory (maybe signaling) function in physiological processes (|CITS:[Siegien06]|, e.g. seed germination (|CITS:[Bogatek99]|  |CITS:[18448476]| |CITS:[Gniazdowska10]|), nitrate assimilation (|CITS:[Solomonson90]|) or in plant responses to stress and other environmental factors (|CITS:[Grossmann96]| |CITS:[21075959]|).
/
/Since the early 1960s, studies have shown that C-14 labeled hydrocyanic acid can be incorporated to |FRAME:ASN| in the seedlings of an array of plants, including sorghum, barley, pea, flax, and soybean |CITS: [4798760]|. Enzymes that catalyze the two sequential reactions, &beta;-cyanoalanine synthase and &beta;-cyanoalanine hydrolase have been isolated and their enzyme activities have been confirmed in |FRAME:TAX-3701| and other higher plants |CITS: [4627358][11060302][1055433][10845460][10889265] [16786295]|. 
/
/A temporal and spatial association exists between ethylene synthesis and cyanide detoxifying activity (this pathway) indicating a semi-quantitative relationship between ACC oxidase and &beta;-cyanoalanine synthase, the two key enzymes of the respective pathways |CITS: [3073064]|.

COMMENT - <b>Notes on this pathway in <i>Arabidopsis</i>,</b>:
/
/The existence of this pathway remains uncertain.  Organisms can use ethanol as a carbon source. Ethanol is oxidized to acetate through acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) |CITS:[15215500]|. From our literature searches, it is unclear whether acetaldehyde is converted into |FRAME:ACET acetate|, |FRAME:ACETYL-COA acetyl-CoA|, both or neither, and we have failed to find reports of enzymes able to catalyze those activities in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, therefore, until additional evidence becomes available, this pathway will remain 'computational'.  Note that both |FRAME:ETOH ethanol| and |FRAME:ACETALD acetaldehyde| have deleterious effects on <i>Arabidopsis</i> growth |CITS:[15215500],[15215505]|.

COMMON-NAME - ornithine-citrulline shuttle
CITATIONS - 15273293:EV-EXP:3547922770:peifenz
COMMENT - In plants photorespiratory glycine oxidation in leaf mitochondria yields ammonia in large amounts. The excessive amount of cytotoxic ammonia inside mitochondria is refixed into glutamate in the chloroplasts |CITS: [19555410]| since the critical enzyme glutamate synthase (GOGAT) is exclusively located in the chloroplasts. However our knowledge about how ammonia is shuffled from mitochondria into chloroplasts is incomplete. The original thoughts are that ammonia itself is either actively or passively transported into chloroplasts and it is in the chloroplasts where ammonia is refixed. Two other proposals emerged since the discovery of a mitochondrial localized glutamine synthase which suggested that ammonia is refixed into glutamine within mitochondria |CITS: [15273293]| and transported, in the form of either glutamine |CITS: [16143558]| or citrulline |CITS: [15273293] [8278506]| into chloroplasts thereafter. In the form of citrulline, the ornithine-citrulline shuttle not only transfers ammonia from mitochondria to chloroplasts, it also simultaneously transfers one molecule of CO2 that is released from photorespiration back into chloroplasts for refixation. However, this proposed dual-functional shuttle comes with an energy cost. Comparing to the conventional proposal of direct ammonia transfer, it would consume two additional molecules of ATP. On the other hand, the glutamine-glutamate shuttle although only transfers ammonia would not cost any additional energy |CITS: [16143558]|.  Up to date, there is not enough evidence to distinguish which one(s) of the three scenarios operate in vivo.

CITATIONS - 17548096:EV-EXP:3483394761:dreher
COMMENT - The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) can be degraded (inactivated) via either decarboxylative or 
/non-decarboxylative oxidation. Decarboxylative oxidation involves plant peroxidase. The pathway
/and role of 
/decarboxylative oxidation in IAA metabolism in higher plants are not clear. Studies in varies plants on 
/non-decarboxylative oxidation suggest it is the major catabolic route of IAA. Different plant species
/however 
/employ different initial steps in non-decarboxylative oxidation. Maize readily oxidizes free IAA
/whereas hybrid 
/aspen oxidizes aspartic acid-conjugated IAA (IAA-asp). Arabidopsis, on the other hand, oxidizes
/both free IAA 
/and IAA-asp. These representative pathways are curated separately in the Metacyc database.  
/
/Several steps in the degradation pathway in Arabidopsis are proposed based on in-vivo feeding
/experiments performed with plants during vegetative growth. The low IAA concentrations  (0.5 uM)
/used in the initial
/feeding experiments are near the endogenous level |CITS: [9733548]|. At 0.5 uM most of the fed IAA
/enters the OxIAA branch. The final compound in this branch was originally identified as an
/OxIAA-hexose |CITS: [9733548]|.
/But, subsequent analyses demonstrate the existence of OxIAA-glucose in untreated
/Arabidopsis seedlings |CITS: [17548096]|. Feeding studies with radiolabeled OxIAA confirm
/that this compound can be glucosylated in vivo, and no other hexoses were found to be attached to
/OxIAA in that study |CITS: [17548096]|. Interestingly, radiolabeled |FRAME: CPD-9567 indole-3-acetyl-N-beta-D-glucose|
/can also be incorporated into OxIAA-glucose, but there is evidence that the radiolabeled IAA-glucose
/can be deglucosylated to radiolabeled IAA in these experiements, and can then proceed down
/the normal OxIAA branch of the pathway. A radiolabeled glucose moeity will be required to ascertain
/if |FRAME: CPD-9567 indole-3-acetyl-N-beta-D-glucose| can be directly oxidized in Arabidopsis.  
/
/At higher auxin concentrations (5 uM), there is a marked induction of the 
/IAA-asp branch indicating differential regulation of the pathway at different auxin levels |CITS: [9733548]|.
/Further oxidation of IAA-asp is only detected 
/when very high levels of IAA are fed to the plants |CITS: [9733548]|.
/No enzyme or gene information is available for the pathway.

COMMENT - Lipid A is a major cell envelop component of Gram-negative bacteria. There is no evidence of existence of 
/lipid A in plants. However many gene homologous of the pathway have been identified from the Arabidopsis 
/genome. It suggests that plants may use a similar pathway in synthesizing structural-similar compounds.

COMMENT - Industrial important yeasts, such as Candida cloacae and Candida tropicalis, are capable of utilizing alkanes 
/and long chain fatty acids as sole carbon sources for growth. Alkanes and long chain fatty acids are firstly 
/metabolized through omega-oxidation. The methyl group at the end of the molecule (the omega carbon) is 
/firstly oxidized to a hydroxyl group, then to an oxo group, and finally to a carboxyl group. The long chain 
/dicarboxylates derived from omega-oxidation then enter the beta-oxidation pathway for further degradation. 
/
/In Candida cloacae and Candida tropicalis, the oxidation of the omega-hydroxy group of the intermediate 
/omega-alcohol, or omega-hydroxy fatty acid, is catalyzed by an alcohol oxidase. This differs from what is 
/known of omega oxidation in other species including animals and certain alkane-, or fatty acid-, utilizing bacteria. 
/In those organisms, the conversion is catalyzed by an alcohol dehydrogenase. 
/
/The finding of the potential Arabidopsis homologous of the yeast alcohol oxidase suggests that plants may also 
/operate such an omega oxidation pathway. Confirmation of the hypothesis awaits the functional characterization 
/of the homologous and the identification of other enzymes involved in the pathway. The role of the pathway in plants is 
/probably in wax biosynthesis, rather than in fatty acid degradation.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Of the ten existing hexitols (|FRAME: CPD-15703|, |FRAME: CPD-12811|, |FRAME: CPD-15702|, |FRAME: SORBITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-12810|, |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: CPD-15701|, |FRAME: CPD-357|, |FRAME: CPD-369| and |FRAME: GALACTITOL|) only three occur naturally - |FRAME: MANNITOL|, |FRAME: SORBITOL| (also known as D-glucitol), and |FRAME: GALACTITOL| (owing to symmetry, D- and L-galactitol are identical).
/
/|FRAME: MANNITOL| is the most abundant polyol in nature, and is found in bacteria, fungi, algae, lichens and vascular plants. It has been reported in more than 100 species of vascular plants |CITS:[stoop96]|, and in many plants it is a major photosynthetic product and form of transportable carbohydrate comprising 10 to 60% of the soluble carbohydrates |CITS:[bieleski82]|.
/
/Mannitol is known as a 'compatible solute'. High compatible solute concentrations prevent loss of water or balance salt accumulation, while not interfering with normal metabolism. D-mannitol-producing plants exhibit a high degree of salt tolerance |CITS:[zhifang03]|.
/
/|FRAME: MANNITOL| protection also occurs at concentrations too low for significant osmotic effects. It has been suggested that sugar alcohols, because of their water-like hydroxyl groups, may mimic the structure of water and maintain an artificial sphere of hydration around macromolecules. They have also been postulated as scavengers of activated oxygen species preventing peroxidation of lipids and resulting cell damage.
/
/Mannitol synthesis in plants  occurs simultaneously with either sucrose synthesis |CITS:[rumpho83]| or with raffinose saccharide synthesis |CITS:[flora93]|. To date no plants have been found that produce only mannitol. D-mannitol biosynthesis in higher plants occurs via the isomerization of fructose-6-phosphate to mannose-6-phosphate, which is in turn converted to mannitol-1-phosphate by the NADPH-dependent mannose-6-phosphate reductase, M6PR. The final step of conversion of mannitol-1-phosphate to mannitol is irreversible. Interestingly, transgenic |FRAME:TAX-3701| plants overexpressing |FRAME:TAX-4045| M6PR were shown to produce mannitol but also a mannitol-derivative: |FRAME:CPD-6021| (GPM), one of two constituents of the industrial sweetener isomalt. Incidentally, these transgenic plants were also shown to have increased salt-tolerance without any observed phenotypical defects |CITS:[zhifang03]|.

TYPES - Ascorbate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - L-ascorbate biosynthesis II (L-gulose pathway)
CITATIONS - 12954627:EV-EXP:3437338211:peifenz
COMMENT - Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an important antioxidant and an enzyme cofactor. Higher plants and higher animals 
/(but not humans) can synthesize ascorbate. Plants provide the major dietary vitamin C source for humans. 
/The plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathways have only been recently proposed. They differ from what was found in 
/mammals. 
/
/<B>About the different routes of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants:</B>
/
/The existence of alternative routes in plants and the contribution of each route to ascorbate biosynthesis in vivo 
/have been under debate. Wheeler et al originally proposed a so called linear L-galactose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-882 L-ascorbate biosynthesis I (L-galactose pathway)|) that will require 
/PMI (phosphomannose isomerase), PMM (phosphomannomutase) and VTC1 (GDP-D-mannose 
/pyrophosphorylase) among the others |CITS:[9620799]|. The failure of detecting PMI activity in many plants in the 
/past has prompted the search for alternative routes and the subsequent proposal of the L-gulose 
/pathway (depicted here) |CITS:[12954627]|, VTC2 cycle (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-12 VTC2 cycle|) |CITS:[17485667]|, and extended VTC2 
/cycle (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-13 extended VTC2 cycle|) |CITS:[17950389]|. However, the recent detection of PMI activity in Arabidopsis, the lower ascorbate 
/contents observed in a PMI silencing line of tobacco, and conversely the higher ascorbate contents obtained in a 
/PMI over-expressing line, and the lower ascorbate levels in the Arabidopsis VTC1 mutants all argue in favor of the 
/linear L-galactose pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|). 
/
/Another controversial is on VTC2/VTC5. Two activities of VTC2 have been reported, GDP-L-galactose 
/phosphorylase and GDP-L-galactose: hexose-1-P guanylyltransferase. One study suggested the major activity of 
/VTC2 being the guanylyltransferase activity |CITS:[17485667]|, whereas another study suggested phosphorylase being the 
/major activity of VTC2 |CITS:[17462988]|. The guanylyltransferase 
/activity is critical for the VTC2 cycle and the extended VTC2 cycle. Nonetheless, both activities lead to the 
/formation of L-galactose-1-P, an intermediate in the L-galactose pathway. Arabidopsis double mutants of 
/VTC2/VTC5 are seedling lethal, which can be rescued by 
/supplementation with L-galactose |CITS:[17877701]|. It demonstrates that the L-galactose pathway is a critical 
/source of ascorbate, at least in Arabidopsis.  
/
/The extended VTC2 cycle, includes an extra yet unidentified enzyme in comparison with the VTC2 cycle. The 
/putative GDP-D-mannose 2"-epimerase catalyzes the reversible conversion of GDP-D-glucose to 
/GDP-D-mannose. GDP-D-glucose, that can be formed by VTC2, strongly inhibits the 
/GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase, another enzyme in the VTC2 cycle. Thus, the conversion of the "toxic" 
/GDP-D-glucose by the extended VTC2 cycle puts the pathway in favor over the original VTC2 
/cycle (reviewed in |CITS:[17950389]|).  In addition, the extended VTC2 cycle can make direct use of D-glucose-1-P which is derived from photosynthesis.   
/
/The intermediate GDP-sugars in ascorbate biosynthesis are also substrates for cell wall polysaccharides and 
/protein glycosylation. 
/
/<B>About this pathway:</B>
/
/GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase converts GDP-D-mannose not only to GDP-L-galactose, an intermediate in 
/the L-galactose pathway, but also to GDP-L-gulose. This finding prompted the proposal of the L-gulose 
/pathway. Further more, feeding Arabidopsis cells with L-gulose or L-gulose-1,4-lactone increased ascorbate level. 
/It again supports the existence of the L-gulose route |CITS:[12954627]|. The L-galactose dehydrogenase purified 
/from pea was shown active with L-gulose, although the enzyme's substrate specificity with L-gulose (Km= 3.7 mM) 
/was very low comparing with its preferred substrate L-galactose (Km= 0.43 mM) |CITS:[12047629]|. It remains to be 
/determined whether it is has a biological role in the L-gulose pathway. L-gulose-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase 
/activity was detected in potato tubers, in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic cell fractions |CITS:[12954627]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Flavones such as apigenin and luteolin represent one of the most abundant and important 
/subclasses of the 9000 flavonoids described so far |CITS: [10652133]|. Flavones belong to the most widespread compounds 
/in plants and have been found in all major land-plant lineages. 
/
/The biosynthesis of flavones has been studied intensively because of their contribution to unique physiological and 
/developmental processes in plants. Luteolin has a defined role as a signalling molecule involved in the induction and 
/expression of nodulation genes |CITS: [3738520]|. Flavones in general have been demonstrated to be significantly 
/involved in the evolvement of the preferred attractant for bee pollinators, i.e. blue flower colours which are restricted to the 
/higher developed angiosperm plant families |CITS: [11130659]|. In addition, flavones possess antioxidative activity 
/|CITS: [11516175]| frequently employed in the prevention of cancer and coronary heart disease |CITS: [16137727]|. 
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The oxidation of flavanones to flavones is catalyzed by flavone synthases introducing a 
/double bound between the C atoms 2 and 3 of the C-ring. Interestingly, the biosynthesis of flavone is carried out by two 
/completely different flavone synthases, i.e. flavone synthase I (EC 1.14.11.22) and flavone synthase II. 
/
/While flavone synthase II (FNS II), a membrane bound cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase is found in many 
/plant families the soluble dioxygenase flavone synthase I (FNS I) has only been isolated from members of the <i>Apiacea</i> 
/family to date |CITS: [2221917]|. FNS I belongs to the family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases which are involved 
/in many different metabolic processes of plants, bacteria, fungi and animals |CITS: [11516175]|. Among the five 
/2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis (compare |FRAME:PWY-3101 flavonol biosynthesis|) FNS I is considered 
/highly pathway specific because of its distinct substrate specificity |CITS: [12782296]|.
/
/The flavone synthases I and II catalyze the 2,3-desaturation of the flavanone in one step, i.e. the formation of apigenin 
/from naringnin and luteollin from eriodictyol, respectively (this pathway). Although it had been suggested that FSN I may 
/catalyze a sequential C3 hydroxylation and dehydration a vicinal desaturation without the release of a free intermediate 
/was experimentally verified |CITS: [12782296]|. The formation of the dihydroxylated B-ring compound luteolin requires an 
/additional hydroxylation step carried out by the cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenase flavonoid 3'(&beta;)-hydroxylase 
/|CITS: [11773526]| |CITS: [UEYAMA02]|. The two possible routes leading to luteolin (via eridictyol or apigenin) are displayed 
/in this pathway.

COMMENT - While |FRAME: TAX-559292 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> S288c| can utilize only a limited range of carbon sources |CITS: [1478472]|
/it can obtain its nitrogen from many different sources, including most amino acids |CITS: [Large 68]|.
/The most common mechanism for retrieving the nitrogen from amino acids is transamination,
/using |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE 2-oxoglutarate| or other 2-oxo acids as amino acceptors. This process leaves
/the carbon skeleton of the amino acid intact, in the form of a 2-oxo acid.
/In a few cases the resulting 2-oxo acid can be directly fed into central metabolism (such as the case of
/|FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE L-alanine| and its derived 2-keto acid, |FRAME: PYRUVATE pyruvate|).
/In most cases, though, the 2-oxo acids resulting from transamination are not intermediates of central
/metabolism, and are excreted from the cells after some transformation.
/
/An important and common pathway for catabolism of amino acids by yeast is the Ehrlich
/pathway |CITS: [Ehrlich07]|. In this pathway, following transamination of an amino acid into the
/corresponding 2-oxo acid, the 2-oxo acid is decarboxylated to an aldehyde.
/Depending on the redox status of the cells |CITS: [12902239]|, the aldehydes can then be either reduced
/(by alcohol dehydrogenases) to alcohols, which are called collectively "fusel alcohols",
/or oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases to organic acids (fusel acids)  |CITS: [15933030]|.
/
/Aromatic amino acids, such as |FRAME:PHE L-phenylalanine|, can be used as a nitrogen source, but not as a
/carbon source. Following the transamination of |FRAME: PHE L-phenylalanine| to |FRAME:PHENYL-PYRUVATE 2-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate|,
/the 2-oxo acid is converted to |FRAME:PHENYLACETALDEHYDE phenylacetaldehyde| and eventually |FRAME:CPD-7035 2-phenylethanol|,
/which is excreted from the cell |CITS: [12902239]|.
/The first step is performed by either of two aromatic amino acid transaminases. |FRAME: MONOMER-11842 aromatic amino acid aminotransferase II|
/is the main catabolic enzyme, and accepts |FRAME:PHENYL-PYRUVATE 2-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate|, |FRAME: PYRUVATE pyruvate|
/or |FRAME: P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate|, but not |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE 2-oxoglutarate|, as the amino
/acceptor |CITS: [6763508][9491082]|.
/However, a reaction utilizing |FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE 2-oxoglutarate| as the amino acceptor
/has also been demonstrated, and is likely catalyzed by |FRAME:MONOMER-11841 aromatic amino acid aminotransferase I| |CITS: [6763508]
/[9491082][9491083]|.
/
/Once transaminated, the 2-oxo acid is decarboxylated by either of four decarboxylases, although
/recent results suggest that the main decarboxylase performing this reaction in vivo is the
/|FRAME:CPLX-7007 2-oxo acid decarboxylase| encoded by the gene |FRAME: G-9197 ARO10|, whose expression increased 30-fold
/when |FRAME:PHE L-phenylalanine| replaced |FRAME: AMMONIA ammonia| as the culture's nitrogen source |CITS: [15933030]|.
/
/The last step of this pathway can be performed by any of the yeast alcohol dehydrogenases
/|CITS: [12499363]|.

COMMENT - The major site for fatty acid &beta;-oxidation in animal cells is the mitochondrion. In contrast, the major sites in plant cells are the peroxisome and glyoxysome (a specialized peroxisome only found in germinating seeds), the mitochondrion is probably only critical for degradation of branched-chain fatty acids. In animal mitochondria, each enzyme of &beta;-oxidation is a separate soluble protein. In contrast, plant peroxisomes and glyoxysomes contains multifunctional proteins (MFP) catalyzing multiple steps in &beta;-oxidation (see the experimentally characterized MFPs in the corresponding MetaCyc pathway). The major different between the animal mitochondrial beta-oxidation and the plant peroxisomal counterpart lies in the beginning step which converts an acyl-CoA to a <i>trans</i>-2-enoyl-CoA. In animal mitochondria, this reaction is catalyzed by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The electrons removed from oxidation pass through the respiratory chain to oxygen and leave H<sub>2</sub>O as the product. In plant peroxisomes, this reaction is catalyzed by acyl-CoA oxidase. The electrons pass directly to oxygen and produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The toxic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is immediately cleaved by peroxisomal catalases.
/
/It is still a debate as whether fatty acids are activated to acyl-CoAs prior or after their transportation into peroxisomes. Two peroxisomal acyl-CoA synthetases have been recently identified and characterized from Arabidopsis |CITS: [12366803]|. Both enzymes are able to activate the full spectrum of fatty acids naturally found in the seed and both genes are strongly induced during seed germination. It suggests the two peroxisomal enzymes are involved in fatty acid &beta;-oxidation.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales, 
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family. 
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many 
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard.
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan 
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on 
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different glucosinolates, 
/of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine (range from homomethionine 
/to hexahomomethionine) (compare |FRAME:PWYQT-4450 aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, side chain elongation cycle|). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among 
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

CITATIONS - 16939316:EV-EXP:3615307731:zhang
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Flavonole such as kaempferol (this pathway) and quercetin and their glucosidic 
/derivatives (compare |FRAME:PWY-5321|) are the major flavonoids found in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [10514319]| 
/|CITS: [16939316]|. Metabolic mutants of Arabidopsis were found to express a different profile of flavonols 
/emphasizing the value of metabolic profiling for the exploration of the underlying pathways |CITS: [GRAHAM98]|. 
/The third main flavonol, |FRAME:MYRICETIN| bearing three hydroxyl groups on the flavonoid B-ring has not 
/been discovered in Arabidopsis indicating that the corresponding biosynthetic branch does not operate in 
/this plant |CITS: [8528278]|.
/
/The occurrence of the two main flavonols kaempferol and quercetin is predominant in different tissues. Quercetin 
/appears to be the main flavonoid in seeds and kaempferol is more prominent in flowers of Arabidopsis |CITS: [ 9112784]|
/|CITS: [8528278]|. Beside the glycosylated monomeric flavonols, dimers and oligomers of flavonols have been 
/identified in Arabidopsis which again accumulate in a spatially and temporally controlled manner that is 
/dependent of seed development and maturation of seeds |CITS: [16395586]|.
/
/The biological function of flavonoids including flavonols such as UV-protection, defense and resistance against 
/biological and non-biological agents and interacting with plant hormones |CITS: [11960739]| has been investigated 
/in depth. However, flavonols also have a significant impact on human health as that they are an important component 
/of the daily diet. Flavonols are involved in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases that have 
/attracted researchers to reveal the causal molecular principles (e.g. |CITS: [16176136]| |CITS: [16097445]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/ Glycosylation is one of the most widespread modifications of plant secondary 
/metabolites that can alter properties and functions of the modified compound |CITS: [16214386]|. The variety 
/of glycosyltransferases and their substrate specificity is impressive and has been reviewed in several papers 
/|CITS: [11469580]| |CITS: [10973093]|. 120 putative UDP-glucose: glycosyltransferases alone have been 
/predicted from the genome of Arabidopsis but for only a few their molecular function has been verified 
/experimentally |CITS: [16214386]|. 
/
/The glycosyltransferases acting in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> have been demonstrated to preferentially 
/transport sugars to the 3-OH and 7-OH position of the C and the A-ring of the flavonol, respectively. The 
/regioselectivity of 91 recombinant glycosyltransferase enzymes in Arabidopsis has been investigated displaying 
/the <i>in vitro</i> range of monoglucosylated (3-<i>O</i>-, 7-<i>O</i>-, 3'-<i>O</i>-, 4'-<i>O</i>-monoglucosides) 
/and diglucosylated (3,7-di-<i>O</i>-glucoside, 7,3'-di-<i>O</i>-glucoside) flavonols |CITS: [15352060]|. 
/
/The enzymes catalyzing the 3-<i>O</i> and 7-<i>O</i>-glucosylation have been purified from Arabidopsis 
/|CITS: [Kim06]| |CITS: [16794327]| |CITS: [14697269]|. Quercetin- and kaempferol-3-rhamnoside are the most 
/abundant flavonols reported and the corresponding enzymes have been purified and characterized via a functional 
/genomic approach just recently |CITS: [12900416]|. The kaempferol biosynthesis as displayed reflects the 
/currently known enzymatic steps and the results of metabolic profiling |CITS: [16939316]| |CITS: [16395586]| 
/but some of the enzymes catalyzing the formation of the |FRAME:CPD-14847| or |FRAME:CPD-8067| remain to be characterized. The identification of the flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnosyltransferase responsible for the formation of major kaempferol and quercetin glycosides in |FRAME:TAX-3701| has been achieved by utilizing transcriptome expression analysis. The molecular function of the flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnosyltransferase (UGT89C1) was confirmed through T-DNA mutants knocked out for the UGT89C1 in which rhamnosylated flavonols could not be found in the metabolic profile. In addition, the recombinant expressed GST-fusion protein demonstrated the very specific 7-rhamnosylation for flavonol mono- and diglucosides |CITS:[17314094]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The transition element molybdenum (Mo) has been long known as an essential micronutrient across the kingdoms of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. However, molybdate itself is catalytically inactive and, with the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, needs to be activated through complexation by a special cofactor. There are several molybdenum cofactors, including |FRAME: CPD-4 molybdopterin| (MPT), |FRAME: CPD-582 guanylyl molybdenum cofactor| (MGD), |FRAME: CPD0-1882 cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor|, or others |CITS: [1587808]|.
/
/The chemical nature and biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactors have been investigated in detail in bacteria |CITS: [7836363][8514783][8514782][1587808][14761975]| and plants |CITS: [16669776][16784786][12147719][16234918][9421926]|. All of the different cofactors are synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-4 molybdopterin| (MPT). The variability of the molybdenum cofactors found in bacteria is achieved by the attachment of GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT.
/
/The MPT structure is conserved in all organisms and it has been demonstrated that its biosynthesis is preserved in bacteria and plants alike. It is produced from |FRAME: GTP GTP| via |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate| (precursor Z) in two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: AT1G01290-MONOMER cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase| and |FRAME: CPLX-7191 molybdopterin synthase| |CITS: [7890743]|.
/
/The small subunits of MPT synthases from different organisms (such as the bacterial |FRAME:EG11597-MONOMER "MoaD"| protein) contain a double glycine motif at the C terminus. The free carboxylate group of the terminal glycine is activated by an accessory protein (|FRAME:EG10154-MONOMER "MoeB"| in bacteria, |FRAME: HS04742 MOCS3| in humans and Cnx5 in plants) to a carboxy-adenylate form, which is then sulfurylated by a sulfurase, resulting in a thiocarboxylate. Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4 molybdopterin| |CITS: [11459846]|.
/
/The insertion of Mo into molybdopterin, forming the biologically active prosthetic group, is catalyzed in eukaryotes by a multifunctional two-domain protein. The protein first activates |FRAME: CPD-4 molybdopterin| to |FRAME: CPD-8122 adenylyl-molybdopterin| |CITS: [15504727][ 9341109][11554796][12590921][10823911]| and then inserts molybdate into the cofactor in a step that involves AMP cleavage |CITS: [16636046][15504727]|. 
/
/In a somewhat analogous manner, in Escherichia coli the MoeA protein mediates ligation of Mo to molybdopterin while the MogA protein enhances this process in an ATP-dependent manner |CITS: [17198377]|.
/
/The insertion of Mo coincides with the release of copper bound to the molybdopterin dithiolate sulfur |CITS: [15306815]| which seems to play a more stabilizing role of MPT-AMP than being actively involved in Mo insertion |CITS: [16636046]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/A difference between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways occurs early in the pathway. In the bacterial pathway, the |FRAME: CPLX0-248 cysteine desulfurase| (IscS) transfers a sulfur atom from L-cysteine directly to the small subunit of the MPT synthase, MoaD. In the eukaryotic pathway the sulfur from L-cysteine is first transferred to a cysteine desulfurylase (|FRAME: HS01304 NFS1|) |CITS: [18650437]|, which transfers it to the sulfurylase domain of |FRAME: HS04742 MOCS3|. The latter transfers the sulfur to the small subunit of the |FRAME: CPLX-8305 molybdopterin synthase|.
/
/Other differences between the two pathways are at the enzyme level. Some of the eukaryotic enzymes are fusion proteins with two functional domains, each catalyzing a different step in the pathway, while the bacterial proteins are single domain enzymes and catalyze only a single step.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The common anthocyanins found in roses are based on the simple structure 
/of cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. This anthocyanin is obviously potent enough to provide the wide spectrum of 
/colors found in roses. Like the anthocyanidin 3-glucoside in other plants (compare |FRAME:PWY-5125|, 
/|FRAME:PWY-5153|; see also |FRAME:PWY-7262|) the anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside constitutes the first stable anthocyanin in roses and 
/contributes to its solubility in the vacuole |CITS: [Heller94]| |CITS: [11960739]|. The pathway described 
/here is unique to the rose family.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The formation of cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside in roses is catalyzed by a distinctive 
/enzyme that is able to glucosylate both the flavonoid A-ring 5-O-position and the 3-O-position of the flavonoid 
/C-ring. In contrast to the two single glucosyltransferases involved in the generation of anthocyanin 3,5-diglucoside 
/in other plants this enzyme possesses both catalytic activities and also changes the order of glucosylation 
/|CITS: [15944692]|. The first intermediate in this pathway is the unstable anthocyanidin-5-O-glucoside which 
/is subsequently further glucosylated to form the stable cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside.
/
/So far the enzyme catalyzing this reaction sequence has not been found in other plants and molecular 
/phylogenetic analysis indicates a significant difference to other anthocyanidin 3- and 5-O-glucosylatransferase 
/subfamily members. It has been proposed that the anthocyanidin 5,3-O-glucosyltransferase encoded by 
/the gene GT1 evolved independently of the typical enzymes involved in anthocyanin pigment metabolism

COMMENT - Camalexin is the main phytoalexin in Arabidopsis. It is involved in plant defense and has cancer-preventive property. The accumulation of camalexin in Arabidopsis is induced by a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi and oomycetes. 
/
/Camalexin was previously proposed to be derived from indole-3-carboxaldehyde, independent of tryptophan. Recently, genetic evidence showed that camalexin is directly derived from tryptophan via indole-3-acetaldoxime, a branch point metabolite that also leads to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites glucosinolates (|FRAME: PWY-601 glucosinolate biosynthesis from tryptophan|) and the plant hormone IAA (|FRAME: PWY-581 IAA biosynthesis I|). Double-mutants of CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 were devoid of camalexin |CITS: [15148388]|. Indole-3-acetaldoxime is consequently converted to indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) by CYP71A13 |CITS: [17573535]|. 
/
/In vivo feeding experiments suggested that the thiazole ring of camalexin is derived from cysteine |CITS: [9046593]|. The exact steps of the thiazole ring formation remained elusive until recently. In a metabolomics study, the IAN conjugate Cys(IAN) was found to be an intermediate of camalexin biosynthesis. The formation of Cys(IAN) possibly proceeds via intermediates &gamma;GluCYs(IAN)Gly and &gamma;GluCYs(IAN). Accumulation of these three compounds was detected in CYP71B15 mutants in an in vivo feeding experiment |CITS: [19567707]|. CYP71B15 was previously shown to catalyze the last step of camalexin biosynthesis, converting dihydrocamalexin (DHCA) to camalexin. CYP71B15 is a novel plant enzyme in that it is the only known cytochrome P450 in plants results in simultaneous decarboxylation and introduction of a C-C double bond |CITS: [16766671]|. More interestingly, CYP71B15 is recently found a multifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversions of Cys(IAN) to DHCA |CITS: [19567706]|. During the conversion of one molecule Cys(IAN) to DHCA,  one molecule of cyanide is released. In planta accumulation of cyanide may shut down the CYP P450 catalyzed camalexin biosynthesis process and thus cyanide is possibly detoxified via the cyanide detoxification pathway (|FRAME: ASPSYNII-PWY cyanide detoxification|). 
/
/The biosynthetic pathway is coordinately induced, strictly localized to the site of pathogen infection |CITS: [17073786]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-8846 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene| (TMTT) is a volatile homoterpene implicated in attracting pollinators or defending against heribivores in many plant species including |FRAME: TAX-3884 <i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>| (lima bean), |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col|, and |FRAME: TAX-4081 <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>| (tomato)  |CITS: [18842097][21088219][10952311][16786318][11710601]|. In some cases, this volatile compound can participate in tritrophic interactions. For example, in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| leaf damage by the specialist herbivore pest |FRAME: TAX-64459 <i>Pieris rapae</i>| can lead to |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT| production which then attracts the parasitoid wasp |FRAME: TAX-32392 <i>Cotesia rubecula</i>| to feed on |FRAME: TAX-64459 P. rapae| larvae and to reduce herbivore-induced damage |CITS: [11710601]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP GGPP| isoprenoid precursor to this pathway is first acted on by a terpene synthase to form |FRAME: CPD-8848 (E,E)-geranyllinalool|. |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT| is synthesized next through the activity of a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, but, the exact mechanism of enzyme action is still being investigated. For instance, it is possible that |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1|, a p450 enzyme from Arabidopsis, may promote the direct transformation of |FRAME: CPD-8848 (E,E)-geranyllinalool|  to |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT| with the concomittant release of |FRAME: CPD-8847 but-1-en-3-one| as depicted in this pathway diagram. However, this reaction is labeled a "hypothetical" because the formation of |FRAME: CPD-8847 but-1-en-3-one| has not been detected in yeast overexpressing |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1|. It is also possible that a two-step conversion may occur that includes the formation of intermediate C-18 compound |FRAME: CPD-12898 (<i>E,E</i>)-farnesylacetone|, but this intermediate has also not been observed in yeast studies using |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| nor did it act as a good substrate for that enzyme |CITS: [21088219]|. However, |FRAME: CPD-12898 (<i>E,E</i>)-farnesylacetone| has been detected to exist in numerous plant species such as <i>Commiphora parvifolia</i> and <i>Salvia hierosolymitana<i> 
/|CITS:[20335939][19935471]|. Several researchers have examined this |FRAME: CPD-8848 (E,E)-geranyllinalool|  to |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT| chemical conversion in different plants (see refs in |CITS: [21088219]|), but further work will be required to clarify the exact manner in which the final step of this pathway is executed. 
/
/
/Several lines of evidence suggest that multiple layers of regulation contribute to the control of |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| and the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT| . For example, |FRAME: AT1G61120-MONOMER GES| and |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| both have increased transcript levels in response to treatment with a fungal peptide elicitor |CITS: [21088219]|. Also, interestingly, mutants that lack |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| fail to make |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT| but do not accumulate its precursor |FRAME: CPD-8848 (E,E)-geranyllinalool| suggesting that some sort of feedback inhibition may control the flux into this pathway |CITS: [21088219]|. In addition, TMTT production depends, in an unknown way, on the jasmonate-signalling associated F-box protein COI1 |CITS: [21088219]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Verbascose and ajugose are two members of the so-called 'raffinose series' of sucrosyl oligosaccharides (also known as raffinose family oligosaccharides, RFOs).  Sucrosyl oligosaccharides represent a large portion of primary oligosaccharides in plants (defined as oligosaccharides synthesized by the action of a glycosyl transferase that mediates the transfer of a glycopyranosyl residue to either the glucopyranosyl or fructofuranosyl moiety of sucrose.  They are differentiated from secondary oligosaccharides which are generated by the hydrolysis of higher oligosaccharides, polysaccharides or heterosides.  For review, see |CITS:[KANDLER82]|).  Members of the raffinose series occur at least in traces in each plant family; it is one of the most widespread sucrosyl oligosaccharide series in flowering plants and might even be ubiquitous (see |CITS:[KANDLER82]| for review).  This series comprises |FRAME:CPD-1099 raffinose|, |FRAME:CPD-170 stachyose|, |FRAME:CPD-8065 verbascose|,|FRAME:CPD-8066 ajugose| as well as several other compounds with a higher degree of polymerization (DP; the highest is a nonasaccharide; none of these higher-DP oligosaccharides in the series have not yet been named).  The sugars of this series consist of &alpha;1,6-linked chains of D-galactose attached to the 6-glucosyl position of sucrose.  They are synthesized in leaves, roots and tubers.  Raffinose and stachyose are the two most commonly found oligosaccharides of this series (see |FRAME:PWY-5337 stachyose biosynthesis|).  However, higher RFOs with DP are also found in certain species such as the frost-hardy <i>Ajuga reptans</i>, in which both short-chain and long-chain RFOs are present and have been speculated to act as antifreeze or antisalt agents |CITS:[12232288],[12228647],[12223871],[10758476]|.  The biosynthesis of higher-DP RFOs appears to occurs via two routes: one is dependent on galactinol, and requires enzymes similar to that of the |FRAME:PWY-5337 stachyose biosynthesis| pathway (this pathway), the other does not appear to require galactinol.
/
/<b>Enzymes of the pathway:</b>
/
/A single enzyme has been described that can catalyze both polymerization steps of this pathway.  This enzyme, galactinol:raffinose galactosyltransferase, catalyzes the chain elongation of RFOs by transferring the &alpha;-galactosyl residue of galactinol to RFO molecules.  The enzyme appears to be primarily a stachyose synthase catalyzing the galactosylation of raffinose into stachyose.  However, it was shown to also use stachyose and verbascose as substrates.
/
/<b>Comment for AraCyc:</b>
/
/Although the presence of verbascose has been confirmed in <i>Arabidopsis</i> |CITS:[ANDERSON01]|, that of ajugose remains uncertain.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Plant membranes have a large component of fatty acids, which help in controlling the permeability of the membrane to solutes moving in and out of cells. A number of cytochrome P450 enzymes participate in fatty acid biosynthesis. Similar to mammalian fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes, plants also posses &omega;-fatty acid hydroxylases. In A. thaliana, a &omega;-fatty acid hydroxylase which catalyzes the &omega;-hydroxylation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [18544608 ]| has been studied. 
/
/Omega fatty acids are postulated to play major roles in plant development and plant defense. In |FRAME: TAX-4102| the characterization of diverse fatty acids in the flower development stages and the enzymes catalyzing them indicate a significant role in stigma-pollen recognition |CITS: [10664841]|. Hydroxylated fatty acids are components of cutin and suberin and play a protective role by deflecting microbial attack.

/
/Esculetin is a common coumarin that may form nonenzymatically from caffeic acid|CITS: [13806518]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components
/of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY pentose phosphate pathway| and the
/|FRAME:TCA TCA cycle I (prokaryotic)|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth
/because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P &beta;-D-glucose 6-phosphate|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P &beta;-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate|,
/|FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE dihydroxyacetone phosphate|, |FRAME:G3P 3-phospho-D-glycerate|,
/|FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE pyruvate|) of the 13 precursor metabolites
/that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other
/needed small molecules. 
/Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.
/
/Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:
/
/i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE pyruvate|, and
/
/ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it
/can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.
/
/Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, 
/glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source
/being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy.
/This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising
/glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered
/functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase"| and
/|FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The standard glycolysis pathway (|FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis I (from glucose 6-phosphate)|) depicts the sugar input into the pathway as
/glucose. However, the glycolysis pathway is utilized for the degradation of many different types of sugars.
/
/This partial depiction of the glycolysis pathway is used with substrates other than glucose, such as |FRAME: ALLOSE D-allose|,
/|FRAME: CPD-9569 L-sorbopyranose| , |FRAME: MANNITOL D-mannitol| , |FRAME: SORBITOL D-sorbitol| , |FRAME: MANNOSE D-mannose| and |FRAME: SUCROSE sucrose|,
/which are processed into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P &beta;-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate|.
/D-fructose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis and is processed to the end product pyruvate, which is often fermented
/further into fermentation products such as |FRAME: ETOH ethanol|, |FRAME: Lactate lactate| and |FRAME: ACET acetate|.

COMMENT - Photosynthetic membranes, such as plant chloroplast membranes, need a certain amount of anionic lipids for their 
/proper function.  These anionic lipids can be either provided as phospholipids (i.e. phosphatidylglycerol) or 
/sulfolipids (i.e. sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol or SQDG).  SQDG is also classified as a glycolipid. However the 
/characteristic structure of SQDG is the unique head group constituent sulfoquinovose, which is a derivative of 
/glucose where 6-hydroxy is replaced by sulfonate. 
/
/The synthesis of SQDG is not crucial under normal growth condition. It only becomes important when phosphate is 
/limited|CITS: [9465123]|. Under such conditions, the increase of SQDG levels compensates the decrease of 
/phospholipids and ensures a constant proportion of anionic lipids in chloroplast membranes |CITS: [14675442]|.

CITATIONS - 12857811:EV-EXP:3417972649:kadreher
COMMENT - Plants need to be able to survive under low oxygen conditions, for example, during flooding. In order to be able
/to maintain glycolysis under these conditions, they need to regenerate NAD+ through fermentation. 
/There is evidence for the presence of the two enzymes required for the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol
/via an acetaldehyde intermediate in Arabidopsis |CITS: [12857811]|.
/
/In general, this is a common natural pathway that is also used for the generation of alcoholic beverages
/and breads.
/
/The enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) catalyzes the key step of this pathway.
/This enzyme is common in higher plants and fungi, but is rare in prokaryotes, and completely absent in
/animals|CITS: [9655927]|. The only prokaryotes in which PDC activity has been confirmed (as of 2007)
/are Zymomonas mobilis, Sarcina ventriculi, Clostridium botulinum,  Acetobacter species and Erwinia
/amylovora  .
/
/While the pathway in mostly known for its occurence in yeast, it is also common in higher plants upon
/conditions of oxygen deprivation caused by flooding (see |FRAME: PWY-3801 sucrose degradation II (sucrose synthase)|).

CITATIONS - RAMAN04:EV-EXP:3328628743:christ
COMMENT - Pantothenate (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>) is the universal precursor for the synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety
/ of coenzyme A and acyl carrier protein. Only plants and microorganisms can synthesize pantothenate
/ <i>de novo</i>. In contrast to the bacterial biosynthesis of pantothenate (|FRAME:PANTO-PWY|), plant pathways
/ for pantothenate formation are incomplete. Feeding studies in <i>Pisum sativum</i> leaf discs support the existence
/ of a similar biosynthesis pathway of pantothenate via pantoate: when fed with [<sup>14</sup>C]valine, the radiolabel
/ was incorporated into &alpha;-oxoisovalerate, oxopantoate and pantoate |CITS:[jones94]|. A number of enzymes involved
/ in pantothenate biosynthesis have recently been studied in Arabidopsis through complementation experiments using
/ <i>E.coli</i> pantothenate biosynthetic mutants |CITS: [14675432]|.
/ The origin of plant &beta;-alanine is uncertain but appears to be different from that of bacteria which synthesize it from
/ L-aspartate. Instead plants seem to produce &beta;-alanine from a variety of other sources, like polyamines, uracil and
/ propionate (see |FRAME:PWY-3941|).

CITATIONS - 17026539:EV-EXP:3483393228:dreher
COMMENT - Ammonium transport is necessary to transport |FRAME: AMMONIUM ammonium| from the soil into the root plasma. They play a 
/role in making available |FRAME: AMMONIUM ammonium| for several metabolic processes, like the conversion of glycine to serine in the 
/photorespiratory nitrogen cycle, deamination of pheylalanine, and degradation of amino acids. The 
/protonated form of |FRAME: AMMONIUM ammonium| is the one that is available from the soil. It is common in the cytosol, 
/mitochondria, vacoules and in the phloem and xylem of plants. 
/
/Physiological studies have shown that there are two types of ammonium transporters, HAT and LAT i.e 
/high and low affinity transporters in plants |CITS: [1261225]|. The expression of these transporters in 
/shoots and roots indicate that they could be involved in intracellular transport within the plant in addition 
/to transporting |FRAME: AMMONIUM ammonium| from the soil across the root plasma membrane |CITS: [14701935]|. These are

COMMENT - In plants, degradation of fatty acids having cis-double bonds on odd-numbered carbons a

CITATIONS - 15653808:EV-EXP:3579412859:dreher
COMMENT - Isoprenoids are among the most diverse and widely distributed natural compounds. They include both
/essential products (sterols, quinones, prenylated proteins, chlorophylls) and secondary metabolites
/(plant terpenoids and hormones) |CITS: [15024605]|.
/
/In this pathway |FRAME:GERANYL-PP| and multiple units of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) undergo a series of polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain of nine units, known as
/|FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE| or solanesyl diphosphate.
/
/The sequential addition of isoprenyl units to |FRAME:GERANYL-PP| is performed by polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzymes such as the |FRAME: TAX-1061| enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-13766|.
/
/Isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by the specific enzyme. Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules, such as quinones.
/On the other hand, the enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a preference towards a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone molecule is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/Quinones with nine isoprenyl units in the side chains are very common. They are the predominant form of plastoquinones, found in green plants and cyanobacteria, and are the major quinones in some large Gram-negative and Gram-positive genera, including the Pseudomonads and the Streptococci.
/For a review detailing the distribution of polyprenyl chain length in different bacteria, see |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Nine-isoprenyl quinones are also found in many animals, including the rat.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-110 "Salicylate"| is an aromatic compound that is is common throughout the plant kingdom and is also found in some bacteria.
/
/Several bacterial genera utilize salicylate as a building block for low-molecular-weight organic Fe3+ chelators (siderophores), such as |FRAME: CPD-9991 yersiniabactin| in |FRAME: TAX-632 <i>Yersinia pestis</i>| and |FRAME: TAX-630 <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i>|, |FRAME: CPD-9992 pyochelin| in |FRAME: TAX-287 <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>|, and |FRAME: CPD-12068 "mycobactin"| in |FRAME: TAX-1773 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>|.
/In bacteria |FRAME: CPD-110 salicylate| is derived from |FRAME: CHORISMATE chorismate| in two steps, via |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE isochorismate|, as described in this pathway.
/
/Salicylate is also important in plants, where it induces flowering and is involved in resistance against pathogen infection through the systematic acquired resistance mechanism |CITS: [15283665][12873532]|.
/While plants can make salicylate in more than one pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-981 salicylate biosynthesis II|), genetic studies in Arabidopsis have shown that the bulk of salicylate is produced from chorismate |CITS: [11734859]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidines can be catabolized through three different pathways. The best characterized is the reductive pathway (this pathway and |FRAME: PWY-3982 uracil degradation II (reductive)|) in which pyrimidines are reduced to&beta;-amino acids, |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE CO<SUB>2</SUB>| and |FRAME: AMMONIA ammonia|. The pathway is found in mammals, plants, some fungi and microorganisms  |CITS:[13428755][13416173][16656066][16655478][10656811]|. The oxidative pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6426 uracil degradation I (oxidative)|) is only found in a few bacterial species and has not been characterized nearly as well. In it uracil is converted to |FRAME: UREA urea| and |FRAME: MALONATE malonate| via |FRAME: BARBITURATE barbiturate| |CITS: [12981104][14955523]|. A third pathway has recently been discovered in E. coli and other bacteria, but has not been characterized yet |CITS: [16540542]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Some bacterial species are known to catabolize pyrimidines via a reductive pathway leading to the production of &beta;-amino acids. The reductive pathway has been observed in various microorganisms including |FRAME: ORG-6124 <i>Clostridium uracilicum</i>| |CITS: [13416173][13416174]|, |FRAME: TAX-12917 <i>Acidovorax facilis</i>| |CITS: [4986615]|, |FRAME: TAX-37762 <i>Escherichia coli</i> B| |CITS: [3553866]|, |FRAME: TAX-287 <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>| |CITS: [1903745]|, |FRAME: TAX-329 <i>Ralstonia pickettii</i>| |CITS: [ 7710277]|, |FRAME: TAX-316 <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i>| |CITS: [Xu92]|, |FRAME: TAX-303 <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>| |CITS: [11759049]|, |FRAME: TAX-292 <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i>| |CITS: [West97]|, |FRAME: TAX-90371 <i>Salmonella enterica</i> enterica serovar Typhimurium| |CITS: [3926948]| and |FRAME: TAX-51101 <i>Brevibacillus agri</i>| |CITS: [12670488]|. 
/
/The reductive pathway of thymine is essentially the same in mammalian tissues |CITS: [12981074][13428755]|. The product of the pathway, |FRAME: CPD-471 (R)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate|, is is a non-protein amino acid |CITS: [4841987]|. The stereoisomer of this compound, |FRAME: CPD-466 (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropanoate|, is produced via the degradation of |FRAME: VAL L-valine| (see |FRAME: VALDEG-PWY valine degradation I|). While the (<i>S</i>) isomer is reabsorbed into the plasma, the (<i>R</i>) isomer is eliminated in urine |CITS: [4841987][6945923]|.
/
/The pathway proceeds in three sequential enzymatic steps. The first enzyme is |FRAME: MONOMER-15398 (NADP)-dependent dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase| (EC 1.3.1.2), which catalyzes the reversible reduction of both |FRAME:URACIL uracil| and |FRAME: THYMINE thymine| to |FRAME: DI-H-URACIL 5,6-dihydrouracil| and |FRAME: DIHYDRO-THYMINE 5,6-dihydrothymine|, respectively. The second enzyme, |FRAME: MONOMER-15399 dihydropyrimidinase| (EC 3.5.2.2) performs reversible hydrolytic ring-opening of |FRAME: DI-H-URACIL 5,6-dihydrouracil| and |FRAME: DIHYDRO-THYMINE 5,6-dihydrothymine| to |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-PROPIONATE 3-ureidopropionate| and |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-ISOBUTYRATE 3-ureido-isobutyrate|, respectively. Finally, |FRAME: MONOMER-15400 3-amino-isobutyrate synthase / &beta;-alanine synthase| (EC 3.5.1.6) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-PROPIONATE 3-ureidopropionate| and |FRAME: 3-UREIDO-ISOBUTYRATE 3-ureido-isobutyrate| to |FRAME: B-ALANINE &beta;-alanine|  and |FRAME: 3-AMINO-ISOBUTYRATE 3-amino-isobutyrate|, respectively, in a reaction that produces ammonium and carbon dioxide.

COMMENT - Guanosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: GMP GMP| (GMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP inosine-5'-phosphate| (IMP) and |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE xanthosine-5-phosphate| (XMP) , which is converted to GMP by the action of
/|FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX GMP synthetase|, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate (see |FRAME: PWY-6125 guanosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis|). Note that the free base |FRAME: GUANINE guanine| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle guanosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathway is responsible for the degradation of the nucleotides to the nucleoside |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| and the base |FRAME: GUANINE guanine|, which can be further degraded via |FRAME: XANTHINE xanthine| and |FRAME: URATE urate|, and eventually catabolized to basic building blocks (see |FRAME: PWY-6595 superpathway of guanosine nucleotides degradation (plants)|).
/
/However, both |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| and |FRAME: GUANINE guanine| can be salvaged by certain enzymes, and be converted back to nucleotide form.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-322 inosine-guanosine kinase| (EC 2.7.1.73), which has been studied in E. coli, can phosphorylate |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| directly to the mono-nucleotide |FRAME: GMP GMP|. Even though genes encoding this enzyme have been identified only in bacteria and archaea |CITS: [10879466]|, this activity has also been reported for artichoke, |FRAME: TAX-4233 <i>Helianthus tuberosus</i>| |CITS: [Combes89]|.
/
/Other routes from |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| to |FRAME: GMP GMP| are described in |FRAME: PWY-6620 guanine and guanosine salvage I| and |FRAME: PWY-6599 guanine and guanosine salvage II|.
/
/Either of these routes enables the organism to salvage the degradation products of guanosine nucleotides, and recycle them back to nucleotide form.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Glycolysis is the 'central' metabolic pathway that can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.  Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions: i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules. In plants, glycolysis is the predominant pathway fueling respiration (see |FRAME:PWY-5690|) because, unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria rarely respire fatty acids.  In plants, this pathway occurs in two different subcellular locations: the cytosol and plastids, which are the sites of |FRAME:PWY-621| and |FRAME:PWY-6724 starch degradation|, respectively.  Whereas the <i>plastidic</i> glycolysis pathway (see |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS|) is identical to the conventional microbial glycolysis, the <i>cytosolic</i> pathway (i.e. this pathway) is slightly modified.  These pathways can interact with one another though the action of highly selective transporters present in the inner plastid envelope |CITS:[Emes93]|.  In chloroplasts in the dark, as well as in plastids of nonphotosynthetic tissues, the primary function of |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS| is the degradation of |FRAME:Starch| to generate carbon skeletons, reductants and ATP for anabolic pathways such as that of |FRAME:PWY-4381| via |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|.   In the cytosol, the same products are generated from the degradation of |FRAME:SUCROSE| via |FRAME:PWY-1042|. In developing oil seeds, phosphoenoylpyruvate derived from |FRAME:PWY-1042| is transported from the cytosol to plastids, where it is further converted to pyruvate then acetyl-CoA to fuel fatty acid and oil biosynthesis|CITS: [17892448][17557808]|.
/
/In the cytosol, there are two alternative reactions to the plasticid pathway: EC 2.7.1.90 and EC 1.2.1.9.  The former represents an alternative to EC 2.7.1.11; this reaction utilizes |FRAME:PPI| rather than ATP to convert |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE|.  The plant cytosol lacks soluble inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatases (PPiases) and, consequently, contains higher concentrations of |FRAME:PPI| (up to 0.3 mM |CITS:[WEINER87]|).  It has been proposed that the utilization of pyrophosphate rather than that of ATP in glycolysis is favored under nutritional <i>Pi</i> deprivation or oxygen deficiency |CITS:[DAVIES93],[15012287]|.  The latter reaction, EC 1.2.1.9, provides a bypass between |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:G3P|, which allows for their conversion without phosphorylation by a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase |CITS:[15012287],[16927206]|.  This reaction produces |FRAME:NADPH| but not |FRAME:ATP|.
/
/<b>Note on the sucrose-starch relationship:</b>  Sucrose and starch biosyntheses are compartmentalized.  Sucrose is synthesized in the cytosol, whereas starch is produced in the plastids.  The two metabolic route intersect however at the level of |FRAME:G3P|, which can be translocated across the chloroplast membrane via a 3PGA/<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> translocator |CITS:[AVIGAD97]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Xylans Xylan| is found in the cell walls of plants and some green and red algae, and is the major constituent of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses hemicellulose|.
/
/By far the more common type of xylan is |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan a (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-xylan|, a linear polymer of |FRAME: BETA-D-XYLOSE &beta;-D-xylopyranose| residues linked by (1&rarr;4) glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide backbone is often decorated by additional sugars, forming complex polymers such as |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan| and |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan|. Arabinoxylans have been identified in wheat, rye, barley, oat, rice, sorghum, as well as in some other plants: pangola
/grass, bamboo shoots and rye grass.
/|FRAME: Glucuronoxylans Glucuronoxylans| and |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylans| are located mainly in the secondary wall and function as an adhesive by forming covalent and non-covalent bonds with lignin, cellulose and other polymers essential to the integrity of the cell wall.
/
/Angiosperm (hardwood) glucuronoxylans also have a high rate of substitution (7080%) by acetyl groups, at position 2 and/or 3 of the &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl
/
/The degradation of cell wall is immensely important in industrial production as a supplement in animal feed, food and beverages, textiles, bleaching and production of biofuels. 
/
/The main enzymes involved in xylan degradation are the xylanases. These enzymes are produced mainly by microorganisms that break down plant cell walls, but are also present in marine algae, protozoans, crustaceans, insects, snails and seeds of land plants |CITS: [9118232]|. 
/The principle source of xylanases for the industry are filamentous fungi, since they secrete these enzymes into the medium and their xylanase levels are very high |CITS: [15944805]|. In recent years there has been a focus on xylanases from extremophiles that can withstand high temperatures and extreme pH found during industrial processes |CITS: [21120468]|.
/
/Due to the complex structure of xylan polymers, degradation requires a number of different types of enzymes working in tandem. These include endoxylanases (|FRAME: 3.2.1.8-RXN "EC 3.2.1.8, endo-1,4-&beta;-xylanase"|; |FRAME: 3.2.1.136-RXN "EC 3.2.1.136, glucuronoarabinoxylan endo-1,4-&beta;-xylanase"|), &beta;-xylosidases (|FRAME: 3.2.1.156-RXN "EC 3.2.1.156, oligosaccharide reducing-end xylanase"|; |FRAME: 3.2.1.37-RXN "EC 3.2.1.37, xylan 1,4-&beta;-xylosidase"|), ferulate esterases (|FRAME: 3.1.1.73-RXN "EC 3.1.1.73"|), acetylxylan esterases (|FRAME: 3.1.1.72-RXN "EC 3.1.1.72"|), &alpha;-glucuronidases (|FRAME: 3.2.1.139-RXN "EC 3.2.1.139"|), arabinases (|FRAME: 3.2.1.99-RXN "EC 3.2.1.99"| and arabinofuranosidases (|FRAME: 3.2.1.55-RXN "EC 3.2.1.55"|).

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CHITIN "Chitin"| is the second most abundant biologically produced polymer (|FRAME: CELLULOSE| is the most abundant).  |FRAME: CHITIN "Chitin"| is found in the cell walls of fungi, yeast and green algae, as well as the exoskeletons of crustaceans (including planktonic types) and insects.  In the marine environment |FRAME: CHITIN| is an abundant polysaccharide that is a source of carbon and nitrogen for marine organisms. Its degradation by several genera of marine chitinolytic bacteria is part of the cycling of nutrients in ocean water. In addition to ocean water, chitinase genes have been identified in bacteria from freshwater and saline lakes, estuaries, and soil. Within bacteria, the ability to degrade chitin appears to be limited to the |FRAME: TAX-1224|, |FRAME: TAX-976|, |FRAME: TAX-201174| and |FRAME: TAX-1239| (in |CITS: [17933912]| and reviewed in |CITS: [21607543]|). Some bacterial species have been shown to contain multiple chitinase genes to efficiently utilize different forms of |FRAME: CHITIN| and some of its by-products |CITS: [16535505]|.
/
/|FRAME: CHITIN "Chitin"| degradation is also important in the terrestrial environment where it is degraded by chitinolytic enzymes in plants, fungi, insects and mammals, as well as other bacteria. The pathway shown here is the beginning of the chitin catabolic pathway as studied in the family |FRAME: TAX-641| (the later part of the pathway is described in |FRAME: PWY-6906|. However, since the enzymes |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.14| and |FRAME: EC-3.2.1.52| are also found in many other organisms, this segment of the pathway is potentially present in a wide taxonomic range.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The |FRAME: CHITIN| catabolic pathway has been studied in species of the genus |FRAME: TAX-662| |CITS: [1761533][11850417][17933912][19553519]|. The proposed pathway shown here for |FRAME: TAX-666| and |FRAME: TAX-29494| involves a core set of genes that appear to be conserved in members of the family |FRAME: TAX-641|. The predicted gene functions are based on a combination of biochemical evidence in |FRAME: TAX-662| species, microarray expression data, experimental evidence, and bioinformatic predictions |CITS: [17933912]|. Overall, |FRAME: CHITIN| utilization is a highly complex process that has been divided into several stages (sensing, attachment, extracellular degradation, uptake and catabolism) and involves many genes |CITS: [14699052][14983042]|.
/
/The overall pathway spans the extracellular space, periplasm, and cytosol. This pathway shows reactions that can occur in the extracellular space and periplasm, as proposed and summarized in |CITS: [17933912]|. The cytosolic reactions are shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6906| as indicated by the pathway link.
/
/Several extracellular chitinases break down the |FRAME: CHITIN| polymer into chitodextrins greater than two residues in length (<i>N</i>-acetyl-D-glucosamine oligosaccharides, GlcNAc<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [9791107][14983042][16535505]|. These oligosaccharides are transported into the periplasm via a specific outer membrane chiitoporin (<b>not shown</b>) |CITS: [10913115]|. Any GlcNAc monomers (|FRAME: N-acetyl-D-glucosamine|) or GlcNAc dimers (|FRAME: CHITOBIOSE|) are believed to enter via nonspecific outer membrane porins (<b>not shown</b>) |CITS: [17933912]|.
/
/In the periplasm, chitodextrinases |CITS: [8969204]| and &beta;-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminidases |CITS: [8969205]| degrade the GlcNAc oligosaccharides to monomers and dimers. The dimer (|FRAME: CHITOBIOSE|) is transported across the inner membrane into the cytosol by an ABC-type transporter (as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6906|) |CITS: [14699052][8969203][17933912]|. The monomer (|FRAME: N-acetyl-D-glucosamine|) can be transported across the inner membrane into the cytosol with concomitant phosphorylation to |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE-6-P| by a PTS<sup>GlcNAc</sup> transporter (as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6906|) |CITS: [8969209][14699052][17933912]|. The |FRAME: TAX-29494| GlcNAc/Glc PTS permease has been partially characterized |CITS: [8969209]|.
/
/Although not shown in this pathway, it has been suggested that because some forms of natural |FRAME: CHITIN| can contain deacetylated residues (see |FRAME: MONOMER-16910| and |CITS: [16878976]|) partially deacetylated chitooligosaccharides might also be found in the periplasm (|CITS: [17933912]|). For example, the disaccharide GlcNAc-GlcN (|FRAME: CPD-12274|) was proposed to be catabolized in the periplasm by a deacetylase (VC1280) |CITS: [17933912]|. However, the VC1280 enzyme (see |FRAME: MONOMERMETA-16870|) was shown by |CITS: [17884842]| to be secreted into the extracellular medium. It was specific for the penultimate GlcNAc moiety at the nonreducing end of chitooligosaccharides, but its action on substrate GlcNAc-GlcN was not experimentally tested. If the proposed product (GlcN)<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: CPD-13545|) is present in the periplasm, it could undergo PTS transport into the cytosol with concomitant phosphorylation |CITS: [14983042][17933912]| as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6906|.
/
/Some other |FRAME: TAX-662| species such as |FRAME: TAX-670| and |FRAME: TAX-663|, contain a gene that encodes an extracellular chitin disaccharide deacetylase, EC 3.5.1.105 (see |FRAME: MONOMER-16793| and |FRAME: MONOMER-15495| for these organisms, respectively). These enzymes hydrolyze the acetamide bond at the reducing end residue of |FRAME: CHITOBIOSE| (the major hydrolysis product of extracellular chitinase) to produce extracellular GlcNAc-GlcN (|FRAME: CPD-12274|). This latter compound has been shown in |FRAME: TAX-670| to be a specific inducer of chitinolytic enzyme synthesis and also a chemotactic attractant in these organisms |CITS: [19553519][21575022]|.

/<b>Carnivorous Plants</b>
/
/A few plants have specialized their physiology to consume and digest insects as a source of nutrients |CITS: [20009546]|. Several species of carnivorous plants are known, including |FRAME: TAX-4375|, popularly known as the pitcher plant. These plants produce pitchers, specialized morphological adaptations geared to trap, retain and digest insects |CITS: [21135573 ]|. The pitchers contain a highly acidic fluid rich in digestive enzymes.
/
/Studies have shown that when a prey is trapped the pH in the picther fluid drops due to the activity of proton pumps |CITS: [11525511]|. Several enzymes have been reported in the pitcher fluid, including &beta;-D-xylosidase, &beta;-1,3-glucanase and chitinases. The chitinases are essential for the degradation of the hard chitin exteriors of the insect preys |CITS: [18183948]|.

COMMON-NAME - malate-oxaloacetate shuttle I
CITATIONS - 14671011:EV-EXP:3545160169:peifenz
COMMENT - Several shuttles exit in cells to transfer and balance reducing equivalents, NAD(P)/NAD(P)H, between different subcellular locations where the reducing equivalents are necessary for different metabolism to continue. Such shuttles include the |FRAME: PWY-6118 G3P suttle|, the |FRAME: MALATE-ASPARTATE-SHUTTLE-PWY malate/aspartate shuttle|, and the malate/oxaloacetate shuttle (depicted here). 
/
/This pathway transports reducing equivalent (NAD/NADH) between the cytosol and the mitochondrion, and involves a cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH) |CITS: [15388227]|, an oxaloacetate/malate antiporter in the mitochondrial membrane |CITS: [14671011]|, and a mitochondrial MDH |CITS: [11773530]|. In the cytosol, oxaloacetate is reduced to malate by electrons from NADH. Malate is then transported into the mitochondrial matrix via an oxaloacetate/malate antiporter. Inside the mitochondrion, malate is oxidized by NAD+ back to oxaloacetate forming NADH. Oxaloacetate is transported back to the cytosol by the oxaloacetate/malate antiporter. In this way, NADH is transferred from cytosol into mitochondria.
/
/The existing of such a shuttle has been reported in wheat and potato |CITS: [14671011]|. It was shown that in the wheat or potato mitochondria, at low physiological NADH concentrations, the malate/oxaloacetate shuttle operated at a high efficiency, with a rate limited by the oxaloacetate/malate antiporter, whereas the presence of either malate/aspartate or G3P shuttle was not observed.

COMMENT - So far malate-oxaloacetate (MAL-OAA) shuttle has been reported to operate between mitochondria and cytosol (See pathway |FRAME: PWY-7047 malate-oxaloacetate shuttle I|), as well as between plastid and cytosol (this pathway). 
/
/This plastidic MAL-OAA shuttle transfers and balances reducing equivalents in the form of malate, between the chloroplast and the cytosol. It removes excess reducing power NADPH from the chloroplast, i.e. NADPH generated by the photosynthetic electron transfer. In this way the electron acceptor NADP+ is regenerated, so that electron transfer and its coupled ATP synthesis can continue.
/
/The plastidic MAL-OAA shuttle not only operates in the light, it also operates in the dark, i.e. in chromoplasts and dark-grown chloroplasts. The difference from the light pathway is that in the dark, NADH (as well as ATP) is generated by the glycolic route (|FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis I|), and as such a NADH-MDH is involved in removing NADH (instead of NADPH) from the chloroplast |CITS: [15032873]|.   
/
/In the MAL-OAA shuttle, malate can be regarded as an indirect hydrogen carrier.

COMMON-NAME - glutamate-glutamine shuttle
CITATIONS - 15273293:EV-EXP:3548014018:peifenz
COMMENT - In plants photorespiratory glycine oxidation in leaf mitochondria yields ammonium in large amounts. The excessive amount of cytotoxic ammonia inside mitochondria is refixed into glutamate in the chloroplasts |CITS: [19555410]| since the critical enzyme glutamate synthase (GOGAT) is exclusively located in the chloroplasts. However our knowledge about how ammonia is shuffled from mitochondria into chloroplasts is incomplete. The original thoughts are that ammonia itself is either actively or passively transported into chloroplasts and it is in the chloroplasts where ammonia is refixed. Two other proposals emerged since the discovery of a mitochondrial localized glutamine synthase which suggested that ammonia is refixed into glutamine within mitochondria |CITS: [15273293]| and transported, in the form of either glutamine |CITS: [16143558]| or citrulline |CITS: [15273293], [8278506]| into chloroplasts thereafter. In the form of citrulline, the ornithine-citrulline shuttle not only transfers ammonia from mitochondria to chloroplasts, it also simultaneously transfers one molecule of CO2 that is released from photorespiration back into chloroplasts for refixation. However, this proposed dual-functional shuttle comes with an energy cost. Comparing to the conventional proposal of direct ammonia transfer, it would consume two additional molecules of ATP. On the other hand, the glutamine-glutamate shuttle although only transfers ammonia would not cost any additional energy |CITS: [16143558]|.  Up to date, there is not enough evidence to distinguish which one(s) of the three scenarios operate in vivo.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Phosphoribosyl-&alpha;-1-diphosphate (PRPP) is the starting point for the 
/<i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of purines (see |FRAME: DENOVOPURINE3-PWY|, |FRAME:PWY-841|) and 
/|FRAME:HISTSYN-PWY| and is the phosphoribosyl donor involved in the biosynthesis and 
/salvage of pyrimidines (see |FRAME: PWY-5686|, |FRAME:PWYQT-4445|) and |FRAME:TRPSYN-PWY|. 
/Therefore PRPP synthases catalyzing PRPP are believed to be essential for all free living organisms |CITS: [15820655]|.
/
/PRPP may be synthesized from ribose 5-phosphate by PRPP synthase or, alternately, by the enzymes 
/phosphopentomutase, ribose 1-phosphokinase (putative), and ribose 1,5-bisphosphokinase as shown in 
/<i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [12700258]|.  
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The PRPP synthases catalyzing the formation of PRPP from ribose 5-phosphate 
/(RPP) can be divided into two classes. Class 1 comprises the 'classical' PRPP synthases requiring inorganic 
/phosphate (Pi) for maximal activity. Class 2 is a recently discovered novel group of PRPP synthases which do not 
/need Pi for activity, exhibit a low specificity for diphosphoryl donors and lack allosteric regulation |CITS: [11278632]| 
/|CITS: [11604537]|.
/
/The genes encoding four isoforms of 5-phospho-D-ribosyl alpha-1-diphosphate synthase, i.e. PRPP synthases 1 to 4 
/have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and partially characterized. PRPP synthases 1 and 2 belong 
/to the classic class I and reach maximal activity only when provided with Pi whereas PRPP synthases 3 and 4 
/were independent of Pi for activity |CITS: [10082968]|. The occurrence of those two classes of PRPP synthases 
/in plants has been discussed as a functional redundancy that may support the PRPP formation over a wide range 
/and more independent of intracellular Pi concentrations.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-110 "Salicylate"| (SA) is common throughout the plant kingdom and is also found in bacteria. It is an important regulator of induced plant resistance to pathogens. 
/
/Salicylic acid can be synthesized from cinnamate. Previous isotope feeding experiments in tobacco and other higher 
/plants, including rice, demonstrated that the direct precursor of salicylic acid is free benzoic acid |CITS: [12231938][9765542]|.
/Benzoic acid is synthesized by cinnamate chain shortening reactions via the so-called &beta;-oxidation, analogous to 
/fatty acid &beta;-oxidation |CITS: [11219576]|. Benzoic acid is then converted to salicylic acid by 
/benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase |CITS: [7479795]|. Recent studies in tobacco indicated that conjugated benzoic acid, 
/CoA thioesters or glucose esters, are more likely to be the precursors of salicylic acid |CITS: [11154339]|. More recent 
/genetic studies in Arabidopsis have shown that salicylic acid can also be synthesized from chorismate and that the bulk 
/of salicylic acid is produced from chorismate (see |FRAME: PWY-6406 salicylate biosynthesis I|) |CITS:[11734859][12167322]|.  However, the presence of |FRAME: CPD-110 "Salicylate"| in <i>ics1 ics2</i> double mutants argues for the presence of an alternative SA biosynthetic route in Arabidopsis |CITS: [18451262]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/
/|FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| (also known as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, or GGPP) is a
/crucial compound involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of terpenes and terpenoids, including
/central compounds such as ubiquinones and menaquinones.
/
/In plants, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP| is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of essentail
/compounds such as chlorophylls, carotenoids, tocopherols, plastoquinones, and gibberellins
/|CITS:[12427975]|, as well as a variety of secondary metabolites.
/
/In addition, GGPP is also used in posttranslational modifications of proteins (geranylgeranylation) which
/is important for membrane adhesion as well as the function of some proteins |CITS:[11500541][16183844]|.
/
/GGPP is synthesized from |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| either by dedicated enzymes,
/such as the |FRAME: MONOMER-13701| of |FRAME: TAX-4932|, or by the action of polyprenyl
/transferases such as the |FRAME: MONOMER-13766| from |FRAME: TAX-1061| or
/|FRAME: CPLX0-7426| from |FRAME: TAX-83333|.
/It should be noted that the building blocks for |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP|
/are synthesized in different organisms by different pathways. While most eukaryotes and some
/bacteria use the |FRAME: PWY-922|, most bacteria, as well as green algae utilize the
/|FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| (as described in the two superpathways |FRAME: PWY-5910| and
/|FRAME: PWY-5121|).
/
/In plants, GGPP is synthesized using both routes - in the cytosol using the |FRAME: PWY-922|,
/and in the plastids using the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY|.
/
/This superpathway describes the production of GGPP via the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY|.
/
/In plants, plastidic GGPP is a central metabolite, involved in the biosythesis of a variety of compounds
/(see list given above).

COMMENT - Acyl-ACP thioesterase releases free fatty acids from Acyl-ACPs, synthesized from de novo fatty acid

/palmitate (C16:0) in the vegetative tissues of all plants. The released free fatty acids are re-esterified to 
/coenzyme A in the plastid envelope and exported out of plastid. 
/
/There are two isoforms of acyl-ACP thioesterase, FatA and FatB. Substrate specificity of these isoforms 
/determines the chain length and level of saturated fatty acids in plants. The highest activity of FatA is 
/with C18:1-ACP. FatA has very low activities towards other acyl-ACPs when compared with C18:1-ACP. 
/FatB has highest activity with C16:0-ACP. It also has significant high activity with C18:1-ACP, followed 
/by C18:0-ACP and C16:1-ACP. Kinetics studies of FatA and FatB indicate that their substrate 
/specificities with different acyl-ACPs came from the Kcat values, rather than from Km. Km values of 
/the two isoforms with different substrates are similar, in the micromolar order. Domain swapping of FatA 
/and FatB indicates the N-terminus of the isoforms determines their substrate specificities|CITS: [12061798]|. 
/For those plants which predominantly accumulate medium-chain length saturated fatty acids in seeds, 
/they evolved with specialized FatB and/or FatA thioesterases|CITS: [11337402]|. For example, 
/laurate (12:0) is the predominant seed oil in coconut. Correspondingly, the medium-chain specific 
/acyl-ACP thioesterase activity was detected in coconut seeds.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/
/&beta;-Alanine is a central component of pantothenate biosynthesis. In bacteria the synthesis of
/&beta;-alanine occurs through the decarboxylation of L-aspartate (see |FRAME: PWY-5155|).
/This route of biosynthesis however
/appears to be unique to prokaryotes and absent in eukaryotes. In several plants species as well as
/yeast &beta;-alanine was shown to be derived from the degradation of polyamines such as spermine
/and spermidine. Radiotracer experiments in |FRAME:TAX-4577| showed that maize shoots can convert
/spermidine and spermine to &beta;-alanine and its biosynthesis intermediate 1,3-diaminopropane
/|CITS:[Terano78]|. Similarly fruit pericarp discs of tomato (|FRAME:TAX-4081|) were

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Chl<i>a</i>) and chlorophyll <i>b</i> (Chl<i>b</i>) are the light harvesting pigments that function to capture photons and transfer them to the reaction centers.  Chl<i>a</i> and Chl<i>b</i> share the same structure except for the side chain at C-7 which is a methyl group in Chl<i>a</i> and a formyl group in Chl<i>b</i>.  Whereas the biosynthesis of Chl<i>a</i> has been widely reported (see |FRAME:PWY-5086| and |FRAME:PWY-5064|), that of Chl<i>b</i> has been more elusive.  Although it has long been known that Chl<i>a</i> appears before Chl<i>b</i> when chlorophyll synthesis begins, little was known of the formation of the formyl group of Chl<i>b</i>.  The discovery of the chlorophyllide <i>a</i> oxidase (CAO) showed that this enzyme was sufficient for the transition of <i>a</i>- to <i>b</i>-type chlorophyll pigments |CITS:[10758481],[10468639]|.  The subsequent reduction of Chl<i>b</i>, back to Chl<i>a</i> (and its hydrolysis to chlorophyllide <i>a</i>) suggested the existence of a cyclic pathway for chlorophylls interconversion |CITS:[8576141],[16228557]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
/|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
/In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Choline is a fundamental metabolite in plants because of its contribution to the synthesis of the membrane phospholipid 
/phosphatidylcholine, which accounts for 40 to 60% of lipids in non-plastid plant membranes |CITS: [12215503]|. Choline 
/is also a precursor for the formation of glycine betaine (|FRAME:PWY1F-353|) in certain plants such as spinach, where 
/this osmoprotectant is accumulated and confers also tolerance to salinity, drought, and other environmental stresses. In 
/addition choline has been recognized as an essential nutrient for humans |CITS: [11481443]|.
/
/The choline biosynthetic pathway enables plants to decouple choline synthesis from lipid metabolism (Kennedy pathway - |FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY|) 
/and provides them with the metabolic flexibility to adapt to environmental conditions where large and variable amounts 
/of choline are beneficial for survival |CITS: [11461929]|.
/
/The first step in choline biosynthesis is the direct decarboxylation of serine to ethanolamine |CITS: [11461929]|, which is 
/catalyzed by a serine decarboxylase unique to plants |CITS: [14634155]|. Ethanolamine is widely recognized as the entrance 
/compound to choline biosynthesis. The synthesis of choline from ethanolamine may take place at three parallel pathways, 
/where three consecutive N-methylation steps are carried out either on free-bases |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92A]|, phospho-bases 
/|CITS: [10799484]|, phosphatidyl-bases |CITS: [11481443]| or a mixture of the latter |CITS: [Datko88a]| |CITS: [Datko88b]|. 
/
/The biosynthesis of choline appears to be regulated by a feedback response of phosphocholine inhibiting its own synthesis 
/by decreasing N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) activities involved in the pathway |CITS: [10799484]|. The activity of PEAMT 
/was considerably increased when plants were exposed to salt stress |CITS: [10799484]| |CITS: [12232019]|, which is 
/consistent with the high demand for choline as osmoprotectant precursor in such plants.
/
/The release of choline from the different pathway levels is species-specific. Phosphocholine can either be directly dephosphorylated 
/to release choline as observed in spinach |CITS: [12232019]| or incorporated into phosphatidylcholine with the subsequent 
/release of choline, as in tobacco |CITS: [10806254]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.  Their diphosphates
/form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, for use in biosynthesis.  The
/pathway for <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is derived from the pathway for
/|FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage
/pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can
/enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and
/|FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are
/necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when
/precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate
/and reducing power.  In |FRAME:TAX-562| they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene
/expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic
/precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA|
/gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine
/ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins
/with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from
/glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to
/form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|. 
/The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG|
/biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from
/|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine
/nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|
/(see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY0-662| and |FRAME: PWY0-661|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|,
/|FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the
/DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are
/synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
/that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair. 
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or
/anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived
/from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|,
/or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.
/
/The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically
/and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257|
/and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a <i>nrdAB</i> deletion mutant. 
/However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes <i>nrdHIEF</i> are overexpressed on a
/plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance
/ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by
/gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812|
/and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied
/|CITS: [16771665]|.
/
/The major pathway for the aerobic, <i>de novo</i> formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate
/precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP|

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of AMP degradation is the conversion of AMP to IMP, which is converted to xanthine in two alternative routes, via |FRAME: XANTHOSINE| or |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE|. The initial step of GMP degradation is the conversion of GMP to guanosine, which is also degraded to xanthine in two ways, via |FRAME: GUANINE| or |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|.
/
/Studies in tea leaves and cultured |FRAME: TAX-4058| cells showed that guanosine deaminase activity was much higher than that of guanine deaminase |CITS: [Ashihara97]|. It indicates the degradation pathway of GMP via xanthosine is likely to be the major route. Xanthine is then converted to urate by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|.  
/
/The product of this pathway, |FRAME: URATE|, is converted to to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.
/
/The plant pathway is very similar to that found in mammals. However, mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-11783| (EC 3.5.4.15) |CITS: [14725335]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6353|).

UNIQUE-ID - NONMEVIPP-PWY
TYPES - Isopentenyl-Diphosphate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - methylerythritol phosphate pathway I
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) can occur via two distinct routes: the |FRAME: PWY-922| (MVA pathway) and the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY| (MEP pathway, this pathway) |CITS: [11078528]|. In the former, IPP is synthesized from the condensation of  three acetyl-CoA molecules; in the MEP pathway IPP is synthesized via the condensation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|.
/
/For many years, the MVA pathway was considered to be the sole source of IPP in all living organisms. However, several inconsistencies led to the discovery of the MEP pathway in bacteria and plants.
/In plants the MVA pathway is located in the cytosol whilst the MEP pathway is found in plastids |CITS:[LICHTENTHALER97]|. The MEP pathway is present in most eubacteria, unicellular green algae, the chloroplasts of phototrophic organisms and some unicellular eukaryotes related to photosynthetic phyla, such as the Plasmodium parasites |CITS: [15473867]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP "Isopentenyl diphosphate"| (IPP) and its isomer |FRAME: CPD-4211| (DMAPP) are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are produced from |FRAME: GAP| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE| via this pathway.
/
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DOXP). DOXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, |FRAME: 2-C-METHYL-D-ERYTHRITOL-4-PHOSPHATE| (MEP). 
/Interestingly, two rather different enzymes, that share no sequence homology, are able to catalyze this reaction - the |FRAME: DXPREDISOM-CPLX "DXR"| enzymes, and the |FRAME:MONOMER-15827 "DRL"| (DXR-like) enzymes |CITS: [20660776]|.
/
/In the third reaction MEP is converted into |FRAME: 4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C|, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding
/|FRAME: 2-PHOSPHO-4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C-MET|. This product is then converted into
/|FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. Subsequently, it is reduced to generate |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| |CITS: [12198182]|.
/
/This diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP in the final step. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this ratio is subsequently adjusted to 3:7 by |FRAME: IPPISOM-MONOMER|. IPP and DMAPP serve as the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.  
/
/The difference between this pathway variant and the variant described in |FRAME: PWY-7560| is the conversion of |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| to |FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. In this variant, that enzyme utilizes flavodoxin as the electron donor (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.b|), while in the other variant the enzyme utilizes ferredoxin (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.1|). The known Arabidopsis enzyme uses ferredoxin |CITS: [15650872]|.

UNIQUE-ID - OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY
TYPES - Pentose-Phosphate-Cycle
COMMON-NAME - pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative branch) I
COMMENT - The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY "pentose phosphate pathway"| is an alternative way of oxidizing glucose, and in this pathway the oxidation is coupled to NADPH synthesis.  As a result, the pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing equivalents for biosynthesis reactions. The pentose phosphate pathway is also important for the conversion of hexoses to pentoses  |CITS: [zubay1983]| .
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pentose phosphate pathway is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of |FRAME:TAX-562|'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|,
/|FRAME: D-SEDOHEPTULOSE-7-P|, and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P|.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which
/|FRAME:TAX-562| is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.
/In addition this pathway is an important source of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, |FRAME: GLC-6-P|, and ends with the formation of two others, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|. 
/
/For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY "oxidative portion"|, in which |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is oxidized to |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P|, and its subsequent |FRAME: NONOXIPENT-PWY "non-oxidative portion"| in which through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| is converted into |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| and |FRAME: GAP|.

TYPES - Choline-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - choline biosynthesis II
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Choline is a fundamental metabolite in plants because of its contribution to the synthesis 
/of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, which accounts for 40 to 60% of lipids in non-plastid plant membranes 
/|CITS: [12215503]|. Choline is also a precursor for the formation of glycine betaine (|FRAME:PWY1F-353|) in certain 
/plants such as spinach, where this osmoprotectant is accumulated and confers also tolerance to salinity, drought, and 
/other environmental stresses. In addition choline has been recognized as an essential nutrient for humans |CITS: [11481443]|.
/
/The choline biosynthetic pathway enables plants to decouple choline synthesis from lipid metabolism (Kennedy pathway - 
/|FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY|) and provides them with the metabolic flexibility to adapt to environmental conditions where 
/large and variable amounts of choline are beneficial for survival |CITS: [11461929]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first step in choline biosynthesis is the direct decarboxylation of serine to ethanolamine 
/|CITS: [11461929]|, which is catalyzed by a serine decarboxylase unique to plants |CITS: [14634155]|. Ethanolamine is
/widely recognized as the entrance compound to choline biosynthesis. 
/
/The synthesis of choline from ethanolamine may take place at three parallel pathways, where three consecutive 
/N-methylation steps are carried out either on free bases, phospho-bases, or phosphatidyl-bases |CITS: [11481443]|.
/
/The N-methylation of free base intermediates has been demonstrated in crude extracts of castor bean (<i>Ricinus 
/communis</i>) endosperm tissue. In this nutritive tissue the first methylation step appears to favor ethanolamine 
/|CITS: [PRUDHOMME92B]| over phosphoethanolamine, which was thought to be the key substrate for further metabolic 
/steps in the plant's choline/phosphocholine biosynthesis |CITS: [Datko88a]| |CITS: [Datko88b]|. The resulting 
/monomethylethanolamine  (MMEta) is than converted partially to dimethylethanolamine (DMEta) or phosphorylated 
/to phosphomonomethylethanolamine (PMMEta). The DMEta is again partitioned between methylation to choline (Cho) 
/and phosphorylation to phosphodimethylethanolamine (PDMEta). Taken together, it has been demonstrated that 
/N-methylation in castor bean takes part on two different levels of intermediates, the free base laevel to produce choline
/(Cho) and the phospho-base level to generate phosphocholine (P-Cho) |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92A]|.
/
/The metabolic fate of the end products of those two pathways is different. Free choline accumulates in a major 
/sequestered pool, and is more or less inaccessible for phosphatidylcholin biosynthesis. In contrast, phosphocholin is
/decidedly involved in this pathway supported by a high in vitro activity of the nucleotide (CDP) pathway |CITS: [KINNEY87]| 
/|CITS: [Tang97]| as found in castor bean endosperm. Although the rate and direction of choline recycling still remains 
/to be investigated, the extractable enzyme activities acting on different intermediate levels indicated a well developed 
/capability of this plant to work efficiently with small, highly regulated pools.

The chemical composition of sporopollenin remains poorly characterized due to its extreme resistance to chemical and biological degradations. However limited data indicates the presence of aliphatic polyhydroxy compounds and phenolic hydroxyl groups |CITS: [14713155]|.  Several genes and their encoded enzymes involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis have been identified in the recent years |CITS: [21193572][19700560][21193570][17496121][19218397]|. The genetic and biochemical data further suggest that sporopollenin components include hydroxylated fatty acids and their derived tetraketide &alpha;-pyrones. The sporopollenin components are presumably coupled with ester and ether linkages. Nonetheless, the exact chemical nature of the sporopollenin polymer and its components still remains to be elucidated. For example, although in vitro enzyme characterization supports the presence of tetraketide &alpha;-pyrones but their occurrence in Arabidopsis has not been reported.

COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis II
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates a route in which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to the deoxyribonucleotides |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: DUTP|, which are subsequently modified to other deoxyribonucleotides, including the thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP|. 
/While most organisms utilize a different route (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|), this pathway is found in bacteria that possess two specialized enzymes - |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.2 "ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.2)"|, an enzyme that can reduce nucleoside triphosphates to their respective deoxynucleoside triphosphates (most organism posses |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "EC 1.17.4.1"|, which can only accept nucleoside diphosphates), and |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 "dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13)"|, an enzyme that can deaminate |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/In this pathway the deoxyribonucleotide |FRAME: DUTP| is formed in two ways - by the direct reduction of |FRAME: UTP|, and by the deamination of |FRAME: DCTP|, which is formed from |FRAME: CTP| either directly by |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, or in two steps, as described in |FRAME: PWY-7184|.
/Once formed, |FRAME: DUTP| is dephosphorylated to |FRAME: DUMP|. Deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| is the major route for <i>de novo</i> formation of |FRAME: DUMP| in aerobically-growing |FRAME:TAX-562|. It supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.
/
/Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| (EC 2.1.1.45).
/The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed in this route, , |FRAME: DUTP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In addtion to their major role as precursors of DNA and RNA synthesis, nucleotides play various additional roles, such as signal transmitters, molecular switches, coenzymes and carriers of energy. for example, the pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are utilized to form active intermediates in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and polysaccharides, respectively.
/
/Nucleotides are susceptible to various chemical modifications caused by endogenous reactive molecules such as reactive oxygen species, chemicals and ionizing irradiation. The incoporation of modified deoxynucleotides into DNA is hazardous and often leads to cell death.
/
/Nucleoside triphosphate diphosphatases (NTPases) are enzymes that hydrolyze the &alpha;-&beta; phosphodiester bond of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). The hydrolysis of this bond, often followed by hydrolysis of the released diphosphate, is a highly exergonic reaction that is often used in cell metabolism to ensure irreversibility of a particular reaction or a pathway. The action of NTPases is often used for the removal of non-canonical nucleotide triphosphates to prevent their incorporation into DNA or RNA or the degradation of a damaged nucleotide |CITS: [15740738]|.
/
/This collection of reactions includes three cases that are dedicated to the hydrolysis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates.
/
/The deoxynucleotide |FRAME: DUTP| is not a building block of DNA, and its incorporation in DNA is hazardous. The enzyme |FRAME: DUTP-PYROP-CPLX "dUTP diphosphatase"| (dUTPase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and diphosphate, acting to ensure chromosomal integrity by reducing the effective ratio of dUTP/dTTP |CITS: [8646528]|.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-8631 "dCTP diphosphatase"| has the highest activity with modified dCTP molecules such as |FRAME: CPD0-1344| and |FRAME: CPD-1094| |CITS: [19220460]|. It has been suggested that despite its activity with dCTP, its <i>in vivo</i> substrates are modified analogs, and its role is the prevention of the incorporation of these analongs into DNA |CITS: [19220460]|.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: G6954-MONOMER|, encoded in |FRAME: TAX-83333| by the |FRAME: G6954| gene, shows high specificity for hydrolysis of oxidized pyrimidine (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates and is therefore expected to function in DNA damage avoidance |CITS: [11053429][11676470]|. Its preferred substrate appears to be |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-CTP| |CITS: [12509230]|. A <i>nudG</i> deletion strain exhibits a 2-3-fold elevated rate of |FRAME:HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|-induced mutations |CITS: [14750949]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE| and |FRAME: URATE|.
/
/The initial step of GMP degradation is the conversion of GMP to |FRAME: GUANOSINE|, which can be degraded to |FRAME: XANTHINE| in two ways (via |FRAME: GUANINE| or |FRAME: XANTHOSINE|) depending on the order in which a deaminase and a nucleosidase act.
/
/Studies in tea leaves and cultured |FRAME: TAX-4058| cells showed that guanosine deaminase activity was much higher than that of guanine deaminase |CITS: [Ashihara97]|. It indicates the degradation pathway of GMP via xanthosine is likely to be the major route in this plant. However, the guanosine deaminase enzymatic activity has not been reported from other sources.
/Regardless of the exact steps leading to its formation, |FRAME: XANTHINE| is converted to |FRAME:URATE| by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|, and the latter is converted to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691|.
/

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
/A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.

/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in the regulation of several crucial physiological and developmental processes in plants, as well as in the adaptative responses to environmental stresses |CITS:[zeevaart88]|.  The regulation of these processes hinges on the size of the bioactive ABA pool.  This pool is thought to be maintained through a finely tuned equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism.  Among the ABA catabolic pathways, the 8'-hydroxylation pathway leading to the formation of phaseic acid (PA) appears to be the major regulation point.  Another important ABA catabolic route operates through the conjugation of ABA (or its hydroxylated derivatives such as PA) with glucose.  One of the most widespread conjugates is |FRAME:CPD-7727| (ABA-GE) |CITS:[16662451]|.  ABA conjugates are thought to be physiologically inactive and to accumulate in vacuoles as the plant matures |CITS:[16664479],[lehmann86]|.  Recently, however, ABA-GE was postulated to be involved in the long-distance transport of ABA through the vascular system |CITS:[11741037],[hansen99]|.
/
/<b>About this pathway:</b>  The glucosylation of ABA to form ABA-GE has been shown to be catalyzed by a number of glucosyltransferases from Adzuki bean and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[12114582],[lim05]|.  These enzymes require UDP-glucose as substrate for the reaction.  They tend to be able to use a variety of substrates such as indole-3-acetate or <i>trans</i>-cinnamate.  The existence of a &beta;-glucosidase able to catalyze the release of ABA from ABA-GE has been reported in crude extracts of barley leaves, more specifically in the intercellular washing fluid |CITS:[10948220]|.

These include GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, GA<sub>5</sub>, GA<sub>6</sub> and GA<sub>7</sub>.  GA<sub>1</sub> is the most active GA for stem elongation in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Pisum sativum</i>, while GA<sub>4</sub> is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth.  In <i>Lolium</i>, GA<sub>5</sub> and GA<sub>6</sub> have been shown to enhance flowering, whilst GA<sub>1</sub> and GA<sub>4</sub> enhanced stem elongation |CITS:[12475622]|.
/
/Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate <i>via</i> the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).  They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME:C20SKELETON| and |FRAME:C19SKELETON|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C20SKELETON|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C19SKELETON|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.  C<sub>20</sub>-GAs do not usually have biological activity but can be metabolized to active C<sub>19</sub>-GAs (note that not all C<sub>19</sub>-GAs are bioactive).
/
/Gibberellins are believed to be synthesized in young tissues of the shoot and also the developing seed.  It is uncertain whether young root tissues also produce gibberellins.  There is also some evidence that leaves may be the source of some biosynthesis.
/
/Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant.  Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits.
/
/Certain commercial chemicals which are used to stunt growth do so in part because they block the synthesis of gibberellins.  Some of these chemicals are |FRAME:CPD-6966|, |FRAME:CPD-6967|, |FRAME:CPD-6968|, ancymidol and |FRAME:CPD-6970| (more inhibitors of GA biosynthesis can be found in |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|).  During active growth, the plant will maintain gibberellin homeostasis by metabolizing most gibberellins by rapid hydroxylation to inactive conjugates.  Active |FRAME:GIBBERELLIN| is degraded much slower which helps to explain the symptoms observed in the disease bakanae caused by the rice pathogen <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  This pathogen produces large amounts of GA<sub>3</sub> which it secretes.  Inactive conjugates might be stored or translocated via the phloem and xylem before their release (activation) at the proper time and in the proper tissue.
/
/<b>This pathway and its enzymes:</b>  The irreversible deactivation of GAs is achieved by 2&beta;-hydroxylation of the active form.  This reaction is performed by dioxygenases known as gibberellin 2-oxidases (GA 2-oxidases) which are essential for effective regulation of GA concentration <i>in planta</i>.  In some tissues such as the cotyledons and the testae of some developing seeds, 2&beta;-hydroxylation is pushed further to form a ketone, hence giving rise to compounds known as 'GA-catabolites'.  These catabolites appear as dicarboxylic acids with an open lactone ring.  It has however been postulated that this open form might be artefactual and the result of the analytical procedure.  Study of recombinant GA 2-oxidases expressed in <i>E .coli</i> showed that ketone formation is relatively inefficient and only occurs when the enzymes is present at high concentrations |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|.  Deactivation of gibberellins by 2&beta;-hydroxylation is not observed in <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: Poly-Gamma-Glutamylcysteine-Glycines Phytochelatins| are oligomers of glutathione that function as metal chelators and are vital for heavy metal detoxification by organisms |CITS: [19224399]|. They are widely distributed among living organisms including fungi, algae, nematodes and higher plants. 
/
/Phytochelatins are formed by the action of the enzyme phytochelatin synthase |CITS: [21369921]|. The enzyme mechanism has been studied in detail and it appears that the substrate is glutathione molecules with blocked thiol groups. Increase in the amount of heavy metals leads to glutathione being blocked, which in turn results in increased phytochelatin synthase activity in the cells |CITS: [19067014][19017114 ]|. In higher plants the phytochelatins are transported to the vacuoles for the sequestering of metal ions away from proteins in the cytosol.

COMMENT - The phytohormone family of auxins regulates many plant biological processes including cell division, elongation,
/differentiation, root initiation, tropic responses, flowering, fruit ripening, and senescence |CITS:[15749753]|. 
/Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the most abundant natural plant auxin.
/
/Several tryptophan-dependent pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of IAA in plants which are shown here.
/In addition, acumulation of IAA in Arabidopsis mutants
/which have tryptophan synthesis blocked at different steps suggests that IAA can be synthesized by a tryptophan
/independent route. Indole-3-glycerol phosphate is the branching point of the tryptophan independent route
/|CITS: [8234297][11069706]|.
/
/IAA can also be conjugated to a number of amino acids and other functional groups (see |FRAME: PWY-1782 superpathway of IAA conjugate biosynthesis|). In some cases, these conjugates can be
/cleaved to release free IAA as well (see |FRAME: PWY-1822 IAA biosynthesis II|).
/
/Agrobacteria, which carry IAA biosynthesis enzymes on the Ti-plasmid, also produce IAA in a different pathway that converts
/tryptophan to indoleacetamide (IAM) and then to IAA through the activity of an IAM hydrolase
/(see |FRAME: TRPIAACAT-PWY tryptophan degradation VII (via indole-3-pyruvate)|). Although this full bacterial pathway is not present in plants, IAM
/and IAM hydrolase activity have been detected in Arabidopsis thaliana and a number of other plant species,
/including rice, wheat, and pea (see references in |CITS: [17555521]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Siroheme is an iron-containing isobacteriochlorin, a modified tetrapyrrole 
/similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll that was discovered in 1973 |CITS: [4583265]|. Siroheme 
/is covalently coupled to an iron-sulfur cluster ([FeS]) to form an electronically integrated metallo-cofactor 
/for delivering electrons to substrate. 
/
/Siroheme biosynthesis starts by the same route as other tetrapyrroles (see |FRAME:PWY-5188|) and 
/branches out on the intermediate |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|. Methylation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| 
/directs it toward siroheme biosynthesis (this pathway), a heme-like prosthetic group that is found in only 
/two but indispensable plant enzymes, sulfite and nitrite reductases |CITS: [9006913]|. On the other side 
/decarboxylation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| results in |FRAME:CHLOROPHYLL-SYN| 
/|CITS: [14633982]| and/or |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II| |CITS: [17416636]|. 
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: For siroheme synthesis, methylation occurs at positions 2 and 7, forming 
/dihydrosirohydrochlorin (also known as precorrin-2) |CITS: [8953249]| |CITS: [9006913]|. The enzyme 
/that catalyzes this reaction(s), uroporphyrin III methyltransferase, requires |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| 
/as a methyl donor, and has been located in the chloroplast which coincides with the localization of 
/other tetrapyrrole biosynthetic enzymes as well as sulfite and nitrite reductase, for which siroheme 
/constitutes a prosthetic group. For instance, through nitrate metabolism many diverse responses at the 
/mRNA level in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> have been demonstrated to occur that involve various enzymes 
/of essential metabolic and signaling pathways |CITS: [10948265]|. In contrast to the trifunctional counterpart 
/enzyme in bacteria the corresponding steps in plants are catalyzed by single enzymes |CITS: [9006913]|. 
/
/The second step of the three step pathway to siroheme, the oxidation of precorrin-2 to sirohydrochlorin is 
/catalyzed by precorrin-2 dehydrogenase, an enzyme that has not yet been characterized in plants. The final 
/step, the chalation of ferrous iron to sirohydrochlorin forming siroheme is catalyzed by sirohydrochlorin 
/ferrochelatase possessing an integral Fe-S center which has been discussed as indication to the close 
/association with the metabolism of sulfur and iron |CITS: [15545265]|.

COMMENT - Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the major lipid reserve in plants and animals. The assembly of TAG occurs in 
/the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Four consecutive reactions are catalyzed by ER membrane bound 
/enzymes. The two intermediates, phosphatidate and 1,2-diacylglycerol, are also substrates for the 
/synthesis of membrane lipids glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides. Thus, the last step in the 
/pathway, catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is the only dedicated step in triacylglycerol 
/synthesis.
/
/The traditional Kennedy pathway does not include the reaction (EC 2.3.1.158, phospholipid:diacylglycerol 
/acyltransferase, PDAT) where phospholipid is 
/utilized as the acyl donor in TAG formation. The role of the PDAT route in TAG 
/biosynthesis was clearly shown in yeast|CITS: [10829075]|. PDAT activity in plants was demonstrated 
/in a few oil seed plants including
/caster bean|CITS: [10829075]|. The caster bean seeds have a high content of
/ricinoleat in the seed oil. Ricinoleat and other unusual fatty acids are
/modified from acyl groups linked to phospholipids, and transferred to
/TAG afterwards. PDAT was proposed playing an important role in
/the last step. However, the contribution of PDAT to TAG biosynthesis in other
/plants is not clear. Overexpressing or knockout of the Arabidopsis PDAT had
/no effect on TAG biosynthesis|CITS: [15247387][15907694]|.
/
/
/The constitution of different species of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-1, sn-2, and 
/sn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone varies among different plants, and is determined by substrate 
/specificities of the three acyltransferases involved in this pathway. The composition of distinct fatty acids 
/in TAG determines the quality and property of lipids of different plants, and also contributes to cold 
/temperature sensitivity of different plants.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Benzoate is derived from the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. A subset of the benzoate-derived compounds, such as |FRAME:CPD-12217|, |FRAME:CPD-6443| |FRAME:CPD-6441|, are volatile and are often important constituents of floral scents |CITS: [15286288][12884048][12226525][12361714]|. In addition, salicylic acid (SA) and methylsalicylate (MeSA) contribute significantly to plant defense signaling |CITS:[19400653]| and benzoate-derived secondary metabolites, such as xanthones |CITS: [20156171][19384730]|, may also help to protect plants from attack |CITS: [16600669]|.
/
/ An important step in the creation of these volatile compounds is the shortening of the 3-carbon side-chain present on trans-cinnamic acid. At least three different biosynthetic routes for volatile benzenoid biosynthesis have been proposed and there is evidence that a subset of the different pathways may operate in individual species. For example, |FRAME:TAX-4102| has at least two pathways present (|FRAME: PWY-6443 "beta-oxidative, CoA-dependent"| and |FRAME: PWY-6444 "non-beta-oxidative, non-CoA-dependent|), whereas cucumber (|FRAME:TAX-3659|) and |FRAME:TAX-49451| seem to lack the "non-oxidative" variant |CITS: [11219576]|. Meanwhile, this pathway, a hybrid between the other two, exists in |FRAME: TAX-140968|. 
/
/A greater understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in benzenoid biosynthesis may contribute to genetic engineering efforts aimed at altering floral scents |CITS: [17234289]|, modifying SA-based defense responses, or changing the levels of other secondary defense metabolites and pigment compounds, such as xanthones |CITS: [11882941]|, that derive from this pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this benzoate biosynthesis variant, the removal of the 2-carbon unit from the side chain is accomplished by adding a water across the double bond in |FRAME: CINNAMOYL-COA| and then removing |FRAME: ACETYL-COA|. Thus, this pathway is CoA-dependent but does not involve the other enzymatic steps associated with &beta;-oxidation |CITS: [11882941]|.  Although all enzymatic activities associated with all of the steps in this pathway have been observed experimentally in |FRAME: TAX-140968|, none of the genes encoding the enzymes have been cloned to date |CITS: [11882941]|.
/
/The activity of several enzymes in this pathway appears to be up-regulated by methyl jasmonate and precedes a rise in the production of xanthones, a class of secondary metabolites made in |FRAME: TAX-140968| |CITS: [11882941]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/A bewildering number of post-transcriptional modifications are introduced into cellular RNAs by different enzymes |CITS: [12581659]|. The most abundant post-transcriptional nucleobase modification in cellular RNAs is the isomerization of
/|FRAME:URIDINE| to |FRAME: CPD-497|, which is carried out by the enzyme pseudouridine synthase in a reaction that does not require any cofactors. In pseudouridine uracil is bound to the to ribose through C5 rather than through N1 as is the case for uridine. The synthase severs the normal glycosidic CN bond of uridine, flips the uracil moiety along its N3C6 axis, and forms a glycosidic C-C bond with C5. Pseudouridine is one of few molecules that have a glycosidic C-C bond.
/
/Pseudouridine synthases belong to four different families, which are represented in |FRAME:TAX-562| by the |FRAME: EG10454|, |FRAME: EG11177|, |FRAME: EG12609| and |FRAME: EG12044|. The only sequence element that is absolutely conserved among the four families of enzymes is a catalytic aspartic acid |CITS: [9425056][11720289][10428788]|.
/
/Pseudouridylation is found in organisms from all kingdoms. Mammalian rRNA contains about 100 pseudouridines per ribosome, and tRNAs contain an average of 3 - 4 pseudouridines. While many eukaryotes possess the ability to degrade pseudouridine, mammals appear to have lost this ability, and pseudouridine is excreted in their urine.
/
/Pseudouridine has been shown to serve as a source of uracil for a strain of |FRAME:TAX-562| that is deficient in pyrimidine synthesis |CITS: [4882030]|. It was shown that pseudouridine was first phosphorylated by a kinase to |FRAME: PSEUDOURIDINE-5-P| |CITS: [4334133]|, followed by hydrolysis to |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and |FRAME: URACIL| |CITS: [4912525]|.
/The genes encoding these two enzymes have been discovered in |FRAME: TAX-364106|, a uropathogenic
/strain |CITS: [18591240]|. The genes were cloned, and the enzymes were purified and characterized,
/conforming the proposed function.
/
/Similar genes were found in the genomes of many bacteria and almost all eukaryotes |CITS: [18591240]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/At the time of this review, over 130 fully characterized gibberellins (starting with GA<sub>1</sub> |CITS:[5638147]|) have been identified in more than a hundred vascular plant species, seven bacteria and seven fungi |CITS:[SPONSEL04],[11986764]|.  Of these gibberellins only a few have biological activity.  Many of the GAs identified early in the history of the discovery of these hormones are the ones which possess the highest biological activity.  These include GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, GA<sub>5</sub>, GA<sub>6</sub> and GA<sub>7</sub>.  GA<sub>1</sub> is the most active GA for stem elongation in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Pisum sativum</i>, while GA<sub>4</sub> is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth |CITS:[12475622]|.
/
/Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate <i>via</i> the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).  They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME:C20SKELETON C<sub>20</sub> skeleton| and |FRAME:C19SKELETON C<sub>19</sub> skeleton|, respectively). 
/
/Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant.  Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits.
/
/Given the important roles that GAs play in plant growth and development, several levels of regulation are used to carefully control the level and types of bioactive GAs present in various tissues. Direct chemical modifications to gibberellins including oxidation (see |FRAME: PWY-102 gibberellin inactivation I (2&beta;-hydroxylation)|, (|CITS: [12481092][10200325]|, <i>et al</i>.)), epoxidation (see gibberellin inactivation III (epoxidation) (PlantCyc)) and methylation (this pathway) |CITS: [17220201]| may be used to reduce the levels of bioactive GAs.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Gibberellin methylation is believed to inactivate bioactive GAs and to lead to their further catabolism |CITS: [17220201]|. The existence of this pathway is supported by the identification of two enzymes from Arabidopsis, GAMT1 and GAMT2, that can catalyze GA methylation <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [17220201]|. Although no methylated forms of GA have been detected in Arabidopsis plants to date, over-expression of the enzymes reduced the levels of active GAs while a <i>gamt1 gamt2</i> double mutant had elevated levels of bioactive GAs arguing that these enzymes do play a role in gibberellin metabolism <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, there is evidence for the existence of methylated GAs as these have been observed in at least one plant species, namely, the fern |FRAME: TAX-84615 <i>Lygodium circinatum</i>| |CITS: [12226326]|. Although gibberellins are produced by a number of fungi (for example, see |FRAME: PWY-5047 gibberellin biosynthesis IV (<i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>)|) and bacteria, there is no evidence to date of GA methyl ester formation in these species, and it may be unlikely to occur in organisms where GA does not play a role as an endogenous signaling molecule that needs to be selectively inactivated |CITS: [19560174]|.
/
/Several lines of evidence suggest that GA methyl esters are not biologically active. Importantly, direct application of exogenous GA methyl esters are not nearly as effective at inducing GA-mediated biological responses as non-methylated GAs in several plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [WEISS93][9701576]|. In addition, the putative GA receptor in rice, GID1, does not bind to GA methyl esters significantly |CITS: [16193045]|. On the other hand, in some assays, methyl or dimethyl-GAs appear to cause biological responses |CITS: [SMITH93][12226326]|. It is possible that specific GA methyl esters will have different biological activities in different species.
/
/The role of GA methylation in various plant processes will also depend on the tissues and organs in which this process occurs. In Arabidopsis, expression of the two GA carboxymethyl transferases is largely limited to siliques during the later stages of development indicating that methylation of GAs might play a limited role in other GA-regulated processes that occur in other organs or in different developmental stages |CITS: [17220201]|. Additional studies on different plant species will reveal if expression during seed development is a generalized trend or if this expression pattern is limited to Arabidopsis thaliana.
/
/Several other plant hormones including jasmonic acid and salicylic acid may be reversibly methylated and later demethylated to be reactivated. There is no evidence to date that GA methyl esters can be cleaved by methylesterases, but, it is interesting to note that the GID1 receptor in rice is part of the superfamily that includes the methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate methylesterases  |CITS: [17220201][16193045]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Inositol is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"| is the  physiologically most common tereoisomer and is abundantly (but not universally) distributed throughout much of the biological system.
/
/|FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"| is an essential polyol in eukaryotes, where its phospholipid derivative |FRAME: L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols phosphatidylinositol| (PI) is an important constituent of phospholipid membranes. PI is also cleaved by phospholipase C to generate inositol phosphate (IP) and diacyglycerol, both of which are central cell signalling molecules.
/
/In prokaryotes inositol is not as widely spread as in eukaryotes. While it is commonly found in archaebacteria, where its derivatives serve an important role in osmotic protection at high temperatures |CITS: [12220406]|, it is absent (or present in very low amounts) from most eubacteria, with the exception of the Actinomycetales group, which includes the streptomycetes, corynebacteria and mycobacteria. In these organisms a phosphorylated inositol is an intermediate in the synthesis of a major thiol called |FRAME: CPD1G-2| |CITS: [11544359]|. Mycothiol is important in maintaining the redox balance in the cell, in protection from oxidative stress, and in cysteine storage.
/In addition, the corynebacteria and mycobacteria produce several cell wall lipoglycans from PI. In these compounds the lipid moieties which are attached to the PI act as anchors in the cell envelope.
/
/PI-containing molecules have been shown to be essential for growth of the fast-growing species |FRAME: TAX-1772|, as mutants lacking PI synthase are not viable |CITS: [10889206]|.
/In most other eubacteria inositol compounds (small soluble molecules or lipids) are undetected or represent very minor components. Earlier work found that various strains of |FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-90371| and |FRAME:TAX-286| sp. did not contain any PI |CITS: [4552305][844323]|. Later work discovered readily measurable amounts of PI and PI synthase in |FRAME:TAX-317|, |FRAME:TAX-549|, and Ice<sup>+</sup> strains of |FRAME:TAX-562| (these are
/strains that promote ice-nucleation) |CITS: [1848220]|.
/However, phosphatidylinositol in these |FRAME:TAX-562| strains represents less than 0.01% of total phospholipid in the cells |CITS: [1848220]|.
/
/In all <i>myo</i>-inositol-producing organisms studied to date <i>myo</i>-inositol is produced via dephosphorylation of  L-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1-phosphate, which is generated from glucose 6-phosphate in a rate-limiting step by L-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIPS).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As shown in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7199|, the deoxyribonucleosides are imported into the cell and phosphorylated by deoxyribonucleoside kinases at the 5' position. The monophosphates are then phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis, as described in this pathway. 
/
/|FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 "dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)"|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 "bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)"| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 "(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)"|.
/
/Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"|.

/|FRAME: Strigolactones Strigolactones| are plant hormones that stimulate the branching and growth of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but inhibit plant shoot branching. They promote the probability of establishment of a symbiotic association between the plant and the fungi.
/
/The first strigolactone (|FRAME: CPD-14655 (+)-strigol|) was described from |FRAME: TAX-3635 <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>| (cotton) infected by the root parasitic weeds |FRAME: TAX-4169 <i>Striga</i>| (witchweed) (hence the name). It has been shown that the seeds of the parasites germinated only if they were exposed to stimulant molecules present in the root exudate of the host. Although the nature of strigol was not understood at the time, it was observed that it was active at hormonal levels |CITS: [17780042]|.
/
/Discovery of additional strigolactones from other plants followed, such as |FRAME: CPD-14659 sorgolactone| from |FRAME: TAX-4558 <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>| |CITS: [Hauck92]|, |FRAME: CPD-14660 alectrol| from |FRAME: TAX-3917 <i>Vigna unguiculata</i>| |CITS: [Mueler92]| and |FRAME: CPD-14657 (+)-orobanchol| from |FRAME: TAX-57577 <i>Trifolium pratense</i>| (red clover) |CITS: [Yokota98]|.
/
/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504 <i>Glomeromycota</i>| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provide the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interaction between the fungi and the roots.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Although the involvement of several dioxygenases in the pathway has been found earlier, full understanding of the earlier steps of the pathway leading to strigolactones biosynthesis was obtained only in 2012 |CITS: [22422982]|. The first committed step is catalyzed by a |FRAME: MONOMER-17611 &beta;-carotene isomerase|, which converts the <i>all-trans</i> version of &beta;-carotene to |FRAME: CPD-14646 9-<i>cis</i>-&beta;-carotene|. A dioxygenase, encoded by the |FRAME: AT2G44990 CCD7| gene, cleaves this molecule between the 10' and 9' positions, producing |FRAME: CPD-14647 9-<i>cis</i>-10'-apo-&beta;-carotenal| (and releasing |FRAME: CPD-7204 &beta;-ionone|).
/The key enzyme of the pathway, encoded by the |FRAME: AT4G32810 CCD8| gene, catalyzes a complex reaction that involves the incorporation of two oxygen molecules and complete rearrangement, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-14649 carlactone|, a precursor of strigolactones that already contains some of the important structural features |CITS: [22422982]|. 
/
/While the later steps of the pathway are not known yet, it has been proposed that only two additional steps may be necessary to obtain the synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-14652 (+)-5-deoxystrigol| |CITS: [22422982]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background:</b> In terms of both frequency and magnitude of plant biomass accumulation, the transfer 
/of the glycosyl moiety is one of the most important biochemical reactions known. Two-thirds of the biosphere`s carbon 
/existing as carbohydrates is due to this kind of reaction. Transfer of the glycosyl moiety from sugar nucleotides to a large 
/number and molecular diversity of acceptors is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases |CITS: [SINNOTT90]|. 
/
/Glucosyltransferases as one subclass of glycosyltransferases are involved in the glucosylation of a broad variety of 
/secondary plant metabolites, amongst them monolignols involved in the metabolic sequence of lignin biosynthesis |CITS: [IBRAHIM77]|
/|CITS: [FOERSTER99]|. Modifying enzymes such as the multigene family of glucosyltransferases contribute to the plasticity 
/of metabolism where corresponding products are either involved in a particular biosynthetic route or may act as gateways 
/into different metabolic pathways |CITS: [11042211]| |CITS: [10973093]|.
/
/The presence and significance to lignification of glucosylated cinnamyl alcohols in the cambium of woody plants were 
/emphasized several decades ago by Freudenberg |CITS: [FREUDENBERG63]| |CITS: [5593877]|. Although glucosyltransferases 
/in general may cover a broad substrate spectrum it has been demonstrated that certain  glucosyltransferases exhibit a 
/rather strict specificity towards their substrates |CITS: [4731963]| |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [15907484]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The most prominent monolignol glucoside accumulating in a variety of plants is the 
/4-O-&beta;-D-glucopyranoside of <i>trans</i>-coniferyl alcohol, i.e. coniferin (|FRAME:PWY-116|). The enzyme catalyzing 
/the formation of coniferin has been purified from different plant sources |CITS: [10853]| and appears to be most active 
/in developing xylem of gymnosperms |CITS: [6210530]| |CITS: [11430981]|.
/
/The UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase (CAGT) also glucosylates sinapyl alcohol with high efficiency in pine 
/cambium |CITS: [SAVIDGE98]| |CITS: [FOERSTER00]| and cell cultures of <i>Forsythia</i> and <i>Rosa</i> spec. 
/|CITS: [IBRAHIM77]| |CITS: [10853]|. In addition, coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes have been converted with comparable 
/catalytic efficiency |CITS: [6210530]| |CITS: [11430981]| |CITS: [10853]|. Recent investigation of the multigene family 
/encoding enzymes conjugating lignin monomers in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [15907484]| revealed a single 
/gene expressing a CAGT highly specific for coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes. The recombinant expressed enzyme 
/significantly differs from the other members of this gene family with regard to substrate preference as they specifically 
/encode enzymes for the glucosylation of the monolignol alcohols. These findings confirm the long assumed incorporation 
/of aldehydic components into lignin because the phloroglucinol-HCl lignin specific dye reaction depends on the presence 
/of aldehyde groups |CITS: [FREUDENBERG68]|.
/
/Additionally, it has been demonstrated that dihydroconiferyl alcohol, a monomer isolated from developing xylem of <i>Pinus 
/contorta</i> |CITS: [SAVIDGE87]| but usually not regarded as an important component of the lignin biosynthetic pathway 
/had also been  converted into the 4-O-&beta;-D-glucopyranoside|CITS: [11430981]|. Moreover, the catalytic activity for 
/the formation of dihydroconiferyl alcohol has been found in the microsomal fraction of developing pine xylem |CITS: [11430982]|. 
/In addition, this rare monolignol has been determined as a major component in lignin of a mutant loblolly pine accounting 
/for around 30% per unit |CITS: [9211851]| emphasizing the metabolic plasticity of monomeric components involved in 
/lignin biosynthesis.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Elemental-selenium Selenium| is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but has not yet been proven to be an essential micronutrient for land plants |CITS: [11683552][16307305]|. There is evidence, however, of Chlamydomonas proteins that contains a |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE selenocysteine| residue suggesting that algal species might also require |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| |CITS: [17105189][12110581]|. The health requirement of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| for humans and animals can be met by crops and forage plants that contain selenocompounds. |FRAME: TAX-4232 <i>Helianthus annuus</i>| among the oilseed crops was shown to be a good source for this micronutrient |CITS: [15012198]|. In addition, there is evidence that certain seleno-compounds, including |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE selenomethionine| and |FRAME: CPD-12024 selenomethylselenocysteine|, have anti-carcinogenic properties |CITS: [14748935]|.   
/
/Despite its importance as a micronutrient, higher concentrations of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| are toxic to humans, other animals, and plants largely because transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur and sulfo-compound metabolism can often erroneously substitute |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| for sulfur and can misincorporate seleno-amino acids into proteins |CITS: [21913064][12753978][16661781]|. 
/
/In general, plants take up both |FRAME: SELENATE selenate| and |FRAME: SELENITE selenite| from soil. A series of |FRAME: PWY-6932 reduction steps| converts |FRAME: SELENATE selenate| to |FRAME: SE-2 selenide| / |FRAME: CPD-678 hydrogen selenide| and this is assimilated into the seleno-amino acids |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE selenocysteine| and |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE selenomethionine| |CITS: [19309459]|.
/
/In Se accumulator plants, these seleno-amino acids may be modified to create storage compounds that are presumably sequestered in the vacuoles. Seasonal weeds like |FRAME: TAX-3575 <i>Silene gallica</i>| and |FRAME: TAX-83445 <i>Avena sterilis</i> ludoviciana| along with perennial weeds like |FRAME: TAX-41550 <i>Cirsium arvense</i>| employ this strategy and accumulate high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| in organic seleno-compounds |CITS: [19800657]|. Se accumulation can help to protect plants against attacks by prairie dogs, insects, and fungi (see refs in |CITS: [21628258]|).
/
/Other plants, like |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| generate seleno-compounds as well, but rather than storing them, they transform them into less toxic volatile compounds
/such as |FRAME: CPD-12005 dimethyl selenide| (DMSe) that can then be released from the plants |CITS: [10759525]|. This process is also called phytovolatilization |CITS: [19656903]|.  
/
/While these strategies directly benefit the plants that employ them, they can also be put to use for the phytoremediation  of seleniferous soils that contain dangerously high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>|. Numerous insights into endogenous seleno-compound metabolism in plants have been gained through efforts to engineer plants that show improved selenium phytoremediation abilities |CITS: [15005814][19800657][19893365][17445958][10759525]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/To reduce the risk of misincorporating |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE selenomethionine| into proteins, this compound can be methylated to form the non-coding seleno-amino acid |FRAME: CPD-12025 Se-methyl-Se-methionine|. Some Se hyperaccumulating plants may sequester this compound.
/
/Both Se-non-accumulators and accumulators may also further metabolize |FRAME: CPD-12025 Se-methyl-Se-methionine| to produce the volatile |FRAME: CPD-12005 dimethyl selenide|. This could occur in at least two manners. In the hyperaccumulator <i>Spartina</i> species, this may occur in a |FRAME: PWY-6935 four-step process| that involves the formation of the intermediate compound |FRAME: CPD-13720 3-dimethylselenopropionaldehyde|. However, this intermediate is not likely produced in Arabidopsis and many other plants. Therefore, this one-step variant has been proposed. Formation of |FRAME: CPD-12005 dimethyl selenide| may be catalyzed by a putative methylmethionine / Se-methyl-Se-methionine hydrolase in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and other plants, but no such enzyme has been identified or characterized yet, particularly with respect to seleno-compound metabolism |CITS: [12376649]|. It is also possible that this reaction may happen spontaneously through chemical decomposition, but this would be expected to occur very slowly at physiological pH.
/
/Roots may be the primary site of |FRAME: CPD-12005 dimethyl selenide| production (see citations in |CITS: [9701603]|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, 
/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions 
/in the cell. Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions. There 
/is also growing evidence that NAD/NADP is also involved in a number of non-redox reactions where they may 
/serve as substrates e.g. for the production of the calcium agonist cyclic ADP-ribose (cADP-R) |CITS: [15086800]|. 
/Moreover, metabolites of NAD and NADP such as nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) have 
/been shown to play important parts in signaling pathways |CITS: [HUNT04]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of NAD is realized via two major pathways, the de novo biosynthesis from L-aspartate (|FRAME:PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|)
/as it takes place in most bacteria and the kynurenine pathway reported for both pro- and eukaryotes where 
/tryptophan degradation is connected with NAD biosynthesis. The late steps of NAD biosynthesis are the same 
/in both biosynthetic routes as they occur via quinolinate, an intermediate common for both pathways |CITS: [16714307]|. 
/In addition, NAD can be re-mobilized from the pyridine nucleotide cycle (|FRAME: PWY-5381|) where NAD 
/degradation joins the recycling of this essential compound |CITS: [Zheng04]|.
/
/In plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate. However, the finding 
/of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway in the genome sequence of 
/rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to be further investigated 
/|CITS: [16698895]| |CITS: [14977569]|. 
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The genome of the dicotyledonous plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> contains homologs 
/to all genes that encode enzymatic steps in the corresponding bacterial pathway, i.e. |FRAME:PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|. 
/Many of those homologous sequences are found in cDNA databases |CITS: [14593172]| which indicates their 
/transcription and functional role as protein encoding genes. 
/
/The first reaction is the conversion of L-aspartate to iminoaspartate catalyzed by the L-aspartate oxidase (AO). 
/This enzyme has been partially purified from cotton |CITS: [6338879]|. The cDNA has also been isolated from 
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and its molecular function confirmed through functional complementation of L-aspartate 
/oxidase deficient E. coli mutants (nadB-) |CITS: [16698895]|. It should be pointed out that the catalyzed reaction 
/differs from the enzyme of the same name, assigned to EC 1.4.3.16, which deaminates L-aspartate forming oxaloacetate 
/and NH3.
/
/Comparable to the L-aspartate oxidase of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the quinolinate synthase (QS) of this plant 
/has been identified using a genomic approach. It could be demonstrated that the recombinant protein complemented 
/quinolinate synthase deficient E. coli mutants (nadA-) as well as the embryo-lethal phenotype of the homozygous 
/allele in Arabidopsis |CITS: [16698895]|.
/
/The third reaction in the early steps of NAD biosynthesis from L-aspartate is catalyzed by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase 
/(QPRtase) which has been isolated and characterized from different plants |CITS: [4422841]| |CITS: [11198422]| 
/|CITS: [16698895]|. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) the first intermediate 
/that is also a component of the NAD recycling cycle |CITS: [Zheng04]| |CITS: [16714307]|.
/
/The activity of the last two enzymes of the pathway, nicotinic-acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMN-AT) 
/and NAD synthase (NAD-S) has been determined in tobacco |CITS: [WAGNER86]| |CITS: [WAGNER86A]|. For 
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> those enzymes have been shown to exist as homologs in the genome, each of them 
/encoded by a single gene |CITS: [HUNT04]| |CITS: [16698895]| |CITS: [14977569]| but their biochemical function 
/remains to be confirmed.

COMMENT - Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. It is synthesized by plants and microbes. The tryptophan biosynthesis 
/pathway in plants is essentially the same as it occurs in microbes|CITS: [7640526]|. The primary role of the pathway in 
/microbes is to supply tryptophan for protein biosynthesis. In contrast, plants also use the pathway to provide 
/precursors for the synthesis of plant hormone auxin and plant secondary metabolites including glucosinolates and 
/alkaloids. Like its counterpart in microbes, the plant enzyme, anthranilate synthase, catalyzing the first step of 
/the pathway is feed-back regulated by the end product tryptophan|CITS: [7972519]|. Interestingly, naturally occurring 
/feedback-insensitive anthranilate synthase has been reported in a few plants|CITS: [9625706][16989878]|. 
/Expression of the Arabidopsis anthranilate synthase genes is induced by wounding and pathogen 
/infection|CITS: [8400875]|. The pathway occurs in the chloroplast|CITS: [7890741]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene| is a bright red carotenoid pigment and phytochemical found in many photosynthetic organisms. Its name is derived from the name of the tomato plant, |FRAME: TAX-4081 <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>|, in which it is found in large amounts.
/|FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene|  is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, which are responsible for pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photo-protection in plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first committed step of carotenoid biosynthesis is that of the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12321 15-<i>cis</i>-phytoene| from |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP all-<i>trans</i>-geranyl-geranyl diphosphate|. This conversion is in fact a two-step reaction catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: AT5G17230-MONOMER phytoene synthase|.
/
/Bacteria and plants differ in their conversion of |FRAME: CPD-12321 15-<i>cis</i>-phytoene| to |FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene|. This pathway describes the pathway found in plant and cyanobacteria, while the bacterial pathway is described in |FRAME: PWY-5942 <i>trans</i>-lycopene biosynthesis I (bacteria)|.
/
/The first committed step of carotenoid biosynthesis is that of the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12321 15-<i>cis</i>-phytoene| from |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP all-<i>trans</i>-geranyl-geranyl diphosphate|. This conversion is in fact a two-step reaction catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: AT5G17230-MONOMER phytoene synthase|.
/In plants |FRAME: CPD-12321 15-<i>cis</i>-phytoene| then undergoes a series of four desaturation reactions leading to the formation of
/|FRAME:CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene| <i>via</i> |FRAME: CPD-7535 9,15,9'-tri-<i>cis</i>-&zeta;-carotene|, |FRAME: CPD-7526 9,9'-di-<i>cis</i>-&zeta;-carotene| and |FRAME: CPD-7496 prolycopene|. To catalyze this transofrmation, plants and cyanobacteria require two phylogenetically related desaturases and two isomerases, encoded by |FRAME: AT4G14210 PDS|, |FRAME: AT1G10830 Z-ISO|, |FRAME: AT3G04870 ZDS| and |FRAME: G-9408 CRTISO|.
/
/The first desaturase, |FRAME: CPLX1F-15 phytoene desaturase| (|FRAME: AT4G14210 PDS|), removes two hydrogens and introduces <i>trans</i> double bonds at 11 and 11', along with a <i>cis</i> bond at the 9 and 9' double bond positions, producing |FRAME: CPD-7535 9,15,9'-tri-<i>cis</i>-&zeta;-carotene| which is isomerized at the 15-<i>cis</i> double bond to |FRAME: CPD-7526 9,9'-di-<i>cis</i>-&zeta;-carotene| by |FRAME: AT1G10830-MONOMER &zeta;-carotene isomerase| (|FRAME: AT1G10830 Z-ISO|).
/
/The downstream steps in the pathway are still under investigation. In one proposed route for |FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene| formation, the second desaturase, |FRAME: CPLX1F-19 &zeta;-carotene desaturase| (|FRAME: AT3G04870 ZDS|), removes two hydrogens and introduces <i>cis</i> double bonds at the 7 and 7' positions, leading to formation of conjugated <i>cis</i> double bonds at 7,9 and 7', 9'. Finally, the second isomerase, |FRAME: MONOMER-12167 carotene isomerase| (|FRAME: G-9408 CRTISO|), isomerizes the <i>cis</i> double bonds at 7,9 and 7', 9', producing |FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene| |CITS: [18948076][20335404]|. The accumulation of |FRAME: CPD-7496 prolycopene| in <i>tangerine</i> tomato mutants |CITS: [15557094]|, as well as the biochemical activities tested for CRTISO and ZDS support the existence of this branch of the pathway |CITS: [18948076][15557094]|.
/
/However, <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic assays reveal that |FRAME: MONOMER-12167 carotene isomerase| (|FRAME: G-9408 CRTISO|) can also act directly on |FRAME: CPD-7524 7,9,9'-<i>cis</i>-neurosporene| indicating that an isomerization of this intermediate might precede the second desaturation. If this is the case, then the following reaction from |FRAME: CPD-12368 9'-<i>cis</i>-neurosporene| to |FRAME: CPD-12371 7',9'-<i>cis</i>-lycopene| would be expected to be catalyzed by a ZDS enzyme. The final proposed step in this pathway has not been experimentally verified but researchers hypothesize that CRTISO would catalyze this alternate reaction that leads to the production of |FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene| |CITS: [15557094]|. 
/
/Additional assays revealed that plants use oxidized plastoquinones as electron acceptors in the desaturation sequence.
/
/Further research will be required to determine whether different plant species use one or more of these alternative routes for producing |FRAME: CPD1F-114 <i>all-trans</i>-lycopene|  <i>in vivo</i>.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-110 "Salicylic acid"| (salicylate; SA) is an aromatic compound commonly found throughout the plant kingdom that is also found in some bacteria.
/
/In plants |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| affects numerous biological and physiological processes, including plant defense (via the systematic acquired resistance system |CITS: [15283665][12873532]|), allelopathy, flowering, and stomatal movement |CITS: [SCHULZ93]|. Given its important signaling role, plants often chemically modify |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| by attaching glycosyl, methyl, or other groups to |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| to alters its activity, volatility, or other properties |CITS [PIERPOINT94][SCHULZ93]|. The formation of |FRAME: CPD-12665 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 5-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| is believed to be a detoxification response by plants to prevent the over-accumulation of toxic levels of |FRAME: CPD-110 SA|. Several physiological problems can result from excess |FRAME: CPD-110 SA|. For instance, in |FRAME: TAX-3617 <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>| high levels of |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| diminish the level of H<sup>+</sup>-efflux and thus completely eliminate potassium uptake in the roots |CITS: [SCHULZ93]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12665 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 5-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| has been identified as an  |FRAME: CPD-110 SA|-metabolite in several species to date, including |FRAME: TAX-3617 <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>|, <i>Cassia absus, Picnomon acarna</i>, and boron-deprived |FRAME: TAX-4232 <i>Helianthus annuus</i>|. Early work on the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12665 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 5-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| in |FRAME: TAX-3617 <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>| identified the proper ordering of the intermediates in the pathway and suggested that the reactions were likely catalyzed by an NADH-dependent monooxygenase and a gentisic acid &beta;-D-glucosyltransferase. These enzymes may act cooperatively based on the observation that |FRAME: CPD-633 gentisate| was never found alone but was always accompanied by |FRAME: CPD-12665 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 5-O-&beta;-D-glucoside|. Enzymatic assays performed using protein extracts from |FRAME: TAX-3617 <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>| indicated that the glucosyltransferase activity was |FRAME: CPD-110 SA|-inducible, and that its specific activity reached a level of 48.8 pKat in extracts generated following 14 hrs of incubation |CITS: [SCHULZ93]|. Unfortunately, neither enzyme from this species was cloned. However, an Arabidopsis glucosyltransferase capable of acting on |FRAME: CPD-633 gentisate| was identified through an <i>in vitro</i> assay. It acts on several other compounds <i>in vitro</i>, so it is unclear whether this does promote the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12665 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 5-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| <i>in planta</i>, however, this compound has been found in Arabidopsis plants with a mutation in |FRAME: AT2G43820-MONOMER UGT74F2|. |FRAME: CPD-12665 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 5-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| may not be a standard SA-metabolite in Arabidopsis, but, it appears that when the two other SA-glucosylation pathways (|FRAME: PWY-6621 I| and |FRAME: PWY-6624 III|) are blocked, Arabidopsis enzymes can detoxify |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| through this alternative route |CITS: [18248508]|.
/
/Interestingly, although radiotracer studies indicate that this pathway does occur in plants |CITS: [18248508][SCHULZ93]|, no plant enzyme catalyzing the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-110 salicylate| to |FRAME: CPD-633 gentisate| has been identified yet, despite the fact that bacterial enymzes that carry out his reaction have been characterized |CITS: [9573207]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-14553| is the activated form of |FRAME: D-galactopyranose|. While it is often produced as an intermediate of galactose catabolism (see |FRAME: PWY-6317|), this nucleotide sugar is also involved in the production of many types of polysaccharides, glycans, and glycoconjugates in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/In prokaryotes, |FRAME: CPD-14553| is a common precursor for O-antigens and S-layer polysaccharides (see |FRAME: PWY-7328|), protein glycosylation (see for example |FRAME: PWY-7037|) and cell wall polymers (see |FRAME: PWY-6397|).
/
/A few examples for eukaryotic polysaccharides whose biosynthesis requires |FRAME: CPD-14553| include xyloglucans (|FRAME: PWY-5936|), glycolipids (|FRAME: PWY-401|), glycosaminoglycans (|FRAME: PWY-6557|), glycoalkaloids (|FRAME: PWY-5666|), fagopyritols (|FRAME: PWY-5380|) and saponins (|FRAME: PWY-5203|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The tripeptide thiol glutathione (GSH; L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) 
/is ubiquitous in the vast majority of organisms. It is considered the most abundant low-molecular weight plant 
/thiol reaching concentrations up to 2-3 mM in the cytoplasm |CITS: [11489184]|. In plants glutathione is linked 
/to many processes, particularly to such involved in protection against a variety of environmental stresses |CITS: [1530873]|. 
/
/Glutathione is an antioxidant that counteracts reactive oxygen species thus reducing oxidative stress |CITS: [NOCTOR98]|. 
/It is recognized as a major player in detoxifying xenobiotics |CITS: [16665956]| by forming less reactive or storage 
/conjugates catalyzed by GHS S-transferases |CITS: [15012285]|. Glutathione has also been reported to detoxify 
/air pollutants such as ozone and sulfur dioxide |CITS: [16668420]|. GHS is discussed as important storage form 
/of reduced sulfur regulating inter-organ sulfur allocation and its biosynthesis seems to be coupled with the sulfate 
/assimilation pathway (see |FRAME:SULFMETII-PWY|) |CITS: [12481075]|. 
/
/Moreover, glutathione appears to act as signaling compound and its homeostasis is crucial for various pathways 
/involved in cellular defense and sulfur metabolism |CITS: [11997376]|. Another main function of glutathione is to 
/dispose supra-optimal concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium that might affect enzyme functions and 
/metabolic networks in plants. As a precursor for phytochelatin, the principal metal-binding agent in plants, glutathione 
/is considered a vital component for the detoxification of heavy metals |CITS: [GRILL85]| |CITS: [16594069]| 
/|CITS: [11402187]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway:</b> The biosynthesis of glutathione is universally catalyzed in all organisms by two enzymes, 
/glutamate-cysteine ligase |CITS: [May94]| |CITS: [15180996]| regarded as the rate-limiting step of the pathway 
/|CITS: [1112810]| and glutathione synthetase |CITS: [8612643]| |CITS: [8914526]| |CITS: [15302873]|. Those two 
/steps comprise the conversion of L- glutamate, L-cysteine, glycine and 2 ATP to glutathione.
/
/The regulation of the plant enzymes is unlike those reported from other eucaryotes. For the glutamate-cysteine ligase 
/a conformational change has been observed as means to modify enzyme activities in response to redox conditions. 
/That differs from mammalian enzymes that regulate activity through a regulatory subunit of the enzyme |CITS: [15180996]|.

COMMENT - Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an important antioxidant and an enzyme cofactor. Higher plants and higher animals 
/(but not humans) can synthesize ascorbate. Plants provide the major dietary vitamin C source for humans. 
/The plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathways have only been recently proposed. They differ from what was found in 
/mammals. 
/
/<B>About the different routes of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants:</B>
/
/The existence of alternative routes in plants and the contribution of each route to ascorbate biosynthesis in vivo 
/have been under debate. Wheeler et al originally proposed a so called linear L-galactose pathway (depicted here) that will require 
/PMI (phosphomannose isomerase), PMM (phosphomannomutase) and VTC1 (GDP-D-mannose 
/pyrophosphorylase) among the others |CITS:[9620799]|. The failure of detecting PMI activity in many plants in the 
/past has prompted the search for alternative routes and the subsequent proposal of the L-gulose 
/pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-11|) |CITS:[12954627]|, VTC2 cycle (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-12|) |CITS:[17485667]|, and extended VTC2 
/cycle (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-13|) |CITS:[17950389]|. However, the recent detection of PMI activity in Arabidopsis, the lower ascorbate 
/contents observed in a PMI silencing line of tobacco, and conversely the higher ascorbate contents obtained in a 
/PMI over-expressing line, and the lower ascorbate levels in the Arabidopsis VTC1 mutants all argue in favor of the 
/linear L-galactose pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|). 
/
/Another controversial is on VTC2/VTC5. Two activities of VTC2 have been reported, GDP-L-galactose 
/phosphorylase and GDP-L-galactose: hexose-1-P guanylyltransferase. One study suggested the major activity of 
/VTC2 being the guanylyltransferase activity |CITS:[17485667]|, whereas another study suggested phosphorylase being the 
/major activity of VTC2 |CITS:[17462988]|. The guanylyltransferase 
/activity is critical for the VTC2 cycle and the extended VTC2 cycle. Nonetheless, both activities lead to the 
/formation of L-galactose-1-P, an intermediate in the L-galactose pathway. Arabidopsis double mutants of 
/VTC2/VTC5 are seedling lethal, which can be rescued by 
/supplementation with L-galactose |CITS:[17877701]|. It demonstrates that the L-galactose pathway is a critical 
/source of ascorbate, at least in Arabidopsis.  
/
/The extended VTC2 cycle, includes an extra yet unidentified enzyme in comparison with the VTC2 cycle. The 
/putative GDP-D-mannose 2"-epimerase catalyzes the reversible conversion of GDP-D-glucose to 
/GDP-D-mannose. GDP-D-glucose, that can be formed by VTC2, strongly inhibits the 
/GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase, another enzyme in the VTC2 cycle. Thus, the conversion of the "toxic" 
/GDP-D-glucose by the extended VTC2 cycle puts the pathway in favor over the original VTC2 
/cycle (reviewed in |CITS:[17950389]|). In addition, the extended VTC2 cycle can make direct use of D-glucose-1-P which is derived from photosynthesis.   
/
/The intermediate GDP-sugars in ascorbate biosynthesis are also substrates for cell wall polysaccharides and 
/protein glycosylation. 
/
/<B>Regulation of ascorbate biosynthesis:</B>
/
/Ascorabte biosynthesis is regulated at multiple levels (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|). Jasmonates, which have been 
/shown to increase ascorbate levels in Arabidopsis, were found to induce expression of several genes in the 
/ascorbate biosynthesis pathway, including VTC1, GME (GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase), and VTC2/VTC5. 
/In addition, VTC2/VTC5, VTC4 (L-galactose-1-P phosphatase), and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase 
/which catalyzes the last step of the L-galactose pathway, were shown regulated by light. The enzyme activity of 
/GME was found under feedback inhibition. Feedback inhibition of VTC2, not at the enzyme activity level, were 
/indicated at the transcriptional level. Experiments with Arabidopsis cell suspension culture indicate that the rate 
/limiting step in ascorbate biosynthesis occurs between D-mannose and L-galactose |CITS:[10517845], [16413588]|. 
/GME possibly catalyzes the rate limiting step in this pathway |CITS:[16413588]|.

COMMENT - Triacylglycerol (TAG) degradation is critical to many plants for which lipids rather than carbohydrates are 
/the major seed storage reserves. The breakdown of the seed storage lipid provides carbon skeletons and 
/energy that can drive postgerminative plant growth before the plant root system and photosynthetic 
/capacity are fully established. 
/
/TAG degradation occurs in the seed oil body where TAG is deposited and stored. The liberated free 
/fatty acids are transported to glyoxysomes where they are converted to acetyl-CoAs via the beta 
/oxidation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5136|). The acetyl-CoAs are eventually converted to carbohydrates via glyoxylate 
/cycle (|FRAME: PWY-561|). It is generally thought that the hydrolytic attack of TAG primarily occurs at the sn-1 or 
/sn-3 positions but not the sn-2 position. Sn-2 monoacylglycerols are naturally racemized to sn-1 
/monoacylglycerols to be completely hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipases (pg255 
/in|CITS: [plantbiochemistry97]|).
/
/Despite the importance of the pathway for plants, there is still not much known about the plant enzymes 
/and genes of the pathway, especially di- and mono-acylglycerol lipases. To date, only an Arabidopsis 
/triacylglycerol lipase has been biochemically and genetically proven to play a role in the breakdown of 
/seed storage TAG during seed germination.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CINNAMOYL-COA (<i>E</i>)-cinnamoyl-CoA| and the closely related compound, |FRAME: P-COUMAROYL-COA 4-coumaroyl-CoA| are important precursors to a number of compound classes, including phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and volatile benzenoids in plants and polyketides in plants and bacteria |CITS: [12502351][19258320]|. Members of these classes can play many roles, for instance as defense, signaling, pigment, and aroma compounds.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Both |FRAME: CINNAMOYL-COA (<i>E</i>)-cinnamoyl-CoA| and |FRAME: P-COUMAROYL-COA 4-coumaroyl-CoA| are derived from |FRAME: CPD-674 <i>trans</i>-cinnamate| produced from |FRAME: PHE L-phenylalanine| by the activity of a phenylalanine ammonia lysase (PAL). Their only structural difference is the presence of a hydroxyl group in the 4-position on the benzene ring. If the hydroxyl group is added directly to |FRAME: CPD-674 <i>trans</i>-cinnamate|, then |FRAME: P-COUMAROYL-COA 4-coumaroyl-CoA| can be made without a |FRAME: CINNAMOYL-COA (<i>E</i>)-cinnamoyl-CoA| intermediate (see |FRAME: PWY1F-467 phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, initial reactions| and |FRAME: PWY-361 phenylpropanoid biosynthesis|). However, as shown in this pathway, |FRAME: CPD-674 <i>trans</i>-cinnamate| can be also be a direct substrate for a CoA ligase. In some cases, the |FRAME: CINNAMOYL-COA (<i>E</i>)-cinnamoyl-CoA| generated by this enzyme may be used directly in secondary metabolic pathways (e.g.benzoate biosynthesis I (CoA-dependent, &beta;-oxidative) (see PlantCyc), pinobanksin biosynthesis (see PlantCyc)), however, it may also be used to produce |FRAME: P-COUMAROYL-COA 4-coumaroyl-CoA| through a late hydroxylation (e.g. curcuminoid biosynthesis (see PlantCyc)).
/
/
/Although PAL has been well-characterized in plants since its initial discovery in 1961 |CITS: [14458851]|, it wasn't until much later than an enzyme believed to be responsible for catalyzing the second step in this pathway was first identified in bacteria |CITS: [12502351]|. 
/
/In plants, the first step in this pathway is often rate limiting, for example, in the production of flavonoids. Therefore, expression levels and activity levels of PAL are often highly regulated and changes are induced by different stresses (rev. in |CITS: [17612622]|, ex. in |CITS: [16456646]|).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Galacturonate (GalA) is a major sugar residue of plant polysaccharides |CITS:[MOHNEN02]| and a minor component of some plant arabinogalactan proteins |CITS:[DARVILL80],[8727785]|.  GalA is also found in various cell-surface polysaccharides of different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (for review, see |CITS:[15563616]|).  The incorporation of GalA into those polysaccharides is performed by transfer of the GalA residue from its activated nucleotide-sugar form: UDP-&alpha;-D-galacturonate (UDP-GalA).  This nucleotide sugar is formed through the conversion of UDP-&alpha;-D-glucuronate (UDP-GlcA) to UDP-GalA by a nucleotide-sugar 4-epimerase.  For some plants, the |FRAME:PWY-4841| leading to the formation of UDP-GlcA from <i>myo</i>-inositol was shown to be a major source of UDP-GalA |CITS:[LOEWUS82]|.  However, <i>myo</i>-inositol is not always a quantitatively important source of carbon for cell wall uronide and pentose units |CITS:[LOEWUS82]|.

COMMENT - Iron deficiency effects all aspects of plant development especially photosynthesis, respiration, 
/and growth processes. Though abundant in soil iron is frequently in an insoluble form and consequently 
/plants have evolved several tightly regulated strategies to absorb this vital micronutrient. Chelation of 
/|FRAME: FE+3| by secreted molecules from the plant roots is one such strategy |CITS: [17449639]|. 
/Under low Fe conditions |FRAME: IRON-CHELATE| reductase is induced wich reduce the 
/|FRAME: FE+3| to |FRAME: FE+2|. This is then taken into the plant by Fe-regulated transporters 
/in the roots |CITS: [GUERINOT07]|, this mechanism is wide spread in non graminaceous plants.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/(+)-Sesamin belongs to the furofuran group of lignans and is widespread among vascular plants. |FRAME:TAX-4182| is broadly cultivated throughout the world because it contains high amounts of sesame oil in its seeds, a natural product which is highly valued because of its antioxidant properties. It has been found that these properties can be attributed to the furfuran lignans present in this oil such as piperitol, sesamin and sesamolin |CITS: [Lewis99]| |CITS: [DAVIN03]|. 
/
/There are many biological effects reported that connect to (+)-sesamin and derivatives thereof which are beneficial 
/for humans from the viewpoint of health care |CITS: [MacRae84]|. (+)-Sesamin was shown to provide protection 
/against liver damage |CITS: [12617602]|, decreased lipid peroxidation |CITS: [14598914]| as a result of elevating 
/the concentration of vitamin E |CITS: [11983822]|, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects |CITS: [10966903]| and 
/inhibition of vascular superoxide production |CITS: [14646174]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/All the lignans that are formed during the course of (+)-sesamin biosynthesis can be found in later phases of the seed development but not in leaves or early stages of seed development indicating a narrow window of corresponding biosynthetic activities |CITS: [16785429]|. 
/
/The enzymatic activity successively converting (+)-pinoresinol to (+)-piperitol and (+)-sesamin has been identified 
/in microsomes of |FRAME:TAX-4182| seeds |CITS: [Kato98]| |CITS: [Jiao98]|. The enzyme, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (CYP81Q1) catalyzes the methylenedioxy bridge formation on different aromatic rings on both ends of (+)-pinoresinol, hence acting as a bifunctional protein |CITS: [16785429]|. The cloning of the gene and characterization of the enzyme provided insight into the mode of action and dismissed the previously proposed mechanism of two independently acting cytochrome P450's involved in those steps |CITS: [Jiao98]|.
/
/Alternative routes that circumvent (+)-sesamin and form (+)-sesamolin via (+)-sesamolinol have been proposed but remain to be experimentally verified (|CITS: [Lewis99]| |CITS: [Kato98]|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: SQUALENE| is a naturally occurring polyprenyl compound primarily known for its key role as
/an intermediate in sterol biosynthesis. The name originates from the scientific name for the shark
/(<i>Squalus</i> spp.), since shark liver oil is considered the richest source of squalene. However,
/squalene is abundant in many plant oils, including olive oil, palm oil, wheat-germ oil, amaranth oil, and
/rice bran oil.
/
/Squalene is structurally similar to |FRAME: CPD1F-129|, and is produced in two steps from two molecules
/of |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| which are joined and reduced by the enzyme
/|FRAME: AT4G34640-MONOMER|. After its biosynthesis, squalene can be transported to other areas
/of the body for incorporation into tissues (in humans, about 60 percent of dietary squalene is absorbed
/and transported in serum to be distributed ubiquitously in different tissues, with the greatest
/concentration in the skin |CITS: [9988781]|) or it can be further metabolized by the enzyme
/|FRAME: YGR175C-MONOMER|, generating |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE|.
/
/The fate of |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| is different in different organisms.
/In animals and fungi it is substrate for |FRAME: ENSG00000160285-MONOMER|, an enzyme that
/generates |FRAME: LANOSTEROL|, a main gateway for the synthesis of all other sterols in these
/organisms, including cholesterol (see |FRAME: PWY66-341|).
/In plants |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| is processed by |FRAME: AT2G07050-MONOMER|, which
/generates |FRAME: CYCLOARTENOL|. This compound is then converted to many different
/sterol compounds (see |FRAME: PWY-2541|).
/
/Sterol biosynthesis by prokaryotic organisms is very rare. However, steroid precursors including
/|FRAME: LANOSTEROL| and |FRAME: CYCLOARTENOL| were isolated from several prokaryotes,
/including |FRAME: TAX-41| |CITS: [12519197]|, |FRAME: TAX-54| |CITS: [Kohl83]|,
/|FRAME: TAX-114| |CITS: [14660793]| and |FRAME: TAX-51353| |CITS: [10802170]|.
/In addtions, genes encoding the enzymes sqalene epoxidase and lanosterol synthase
/have been cloned from |FRAME: TAX-414| |CITS: [17928701]|.

CITATIONS - 14561407:EV-EXP-IDA:3536962725:dreher
COMMENT - In recent years the destruction of the ozone layer due to the action of halogen radicals and its negative effects on earth has occupied scientific and popular imagination. Methyl halides from biogenic emissions are the main transporters of halogen radicals from the atmosphere to stratosphere. Of the halides, |FRAME: CPD-845 methyl chloride| is the most abundant and is released from specific fungi and plants and by the burning of biomass. |FRAME: CPD-12221 methyl bromide|, which was extensively used as a soil fumigant and is known to strongly deplete stratospheric ozone, has been prohibited in recent times, but is produced by some marine organisms. |FRAME: CPD-7676 methyl iodide| has lesser half life that |FRAME: CPD-845 methyl chloride| and |FRAME: CPD-12221 methyl bromide| but is known to affect the formation of marine aerosol formation and cloud condensation nuclei |CITS: [10508052]|. 
/
/The anthropogenic, marine and terrestrial biogenic sources of halides are known |CITS: [11791711][10508052]|, but the mechanisms of biosynthesis are poorly understood. The enzymes involved are halide ion methyltransferase (HMT) and halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT). Several flowering plant families are involved in the formation of methyl halides |CITS: [2371563] [ 7721844]|.

COMMENT - Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP inosine-5'-phosphate| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC adenylo-succinate| , which is converted to AMP by the action of
/|FRAME: ASL-MONOMER adenylosuccinate lyase| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126 adenosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis|). Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE adenine| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE adenine|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY adenosine nucleotides degradation II|).
/
/However, both |FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine| and |FRAME: ADENINE adenine| can be salvaged by certain enzymes, and be converted back to nucleotide form.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: HS08097-MONOMER adenosine kinase| (EC 2.7.1.20) can phosphorylate |FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine| directly to the mono-nucleotide |FRAME: AMP AMP|. The enzyme has been described in bacteria, yeast, plants and animals |CITS: [5092557][8577746][11115893][16511094][17869216][19329636]|. 
/
/Other routes from |FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine| to |FRAME: AMP AMP| involve two steps, and are described in |FRAME: P121-PWY adenine and adenosine salvage I| and |FRAME: PWY-6605 adenine and adenosine salvage II|.
/
/Either of these routes enables the organism to salvage the degradation products of adenosine nucleotides, and recycle  them back to nucleotide form.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Cytokinins play important physiological roles in plants, from promotion of cell division, to release of lateral buds from apical dominance or delay of senescence. Although their biological activity, signal transduction and metabolism have long been studied, much remains to be uncovered of their genetics and biosynthesis |CITS: [11337393]|.
/
/The natural cytokinins are adenine derivatives and can be classified by the configuration of their <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-side chain as either isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins by far are those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210 <i>trans</i>-zeatin| and its derivatives.
/
/In terms of biological activity, it would seem that, at least in the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>|, two cytokinin species: |FRAME: CPD-4210 <i>trans</i>-zeatin| (<i>t</i>Z) and |FRAME: CPD-4209 <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-dimethylallyladenine| (iP), are considered to be active forms. By contrast, |FRAME: CPD-4441 <i>cis</i>-zeatin| (<i>c</i>Z) exhibits only low or no activity in this plant. It has been suggested that |FRAME: CPD-4441 <i>cis</i>-zeatin| might contribute to the synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-4210 <i>trans</i>-zeatin| through interconversion by a zeatin <i>cis-trans</i>-isomerase |CITS:[12231873]|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-4441 <i>cis</i>-zeatin| is described in |FRAME: PWY-2781 <i>cis</i>-zeatin biosynthesis|.
/
/Multiple routes have been proposed for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-4210 <i>trans</i>-zeatin|. One pathway is described here. A second, tRNA pathway has been proposed based on the discovery that some tRNA molecules contain an |FRAME: CPD-4207 isopentenyl adenosine| (iPA) residue at the site adjacent to the anticodon |CITS:[402938]|. The modification is catalyzed by an enzyme that has been identified in various organisms including <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS: [4346747]|, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [4311031]|, <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> |CITS: [809333]|, <i>Homo sapiens</i> |CITS: [11111046]| and <i>Zea mays</i> |CITS: [342386]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway thought to produce the majority of <i>de novo</i> cytokinins utilizes |FRAME: CPD-4211 dimethylallyl diphosphate| and AMP, ADP or ATP as substrates, and proceeds via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-4205 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-monophosphate|.
/The isopentenyl group of |FRAME: CPD-4211 dimethylallyl diphosphate| is transferred to the N<sup>6</sup> of AMP, ADP or ATP, resulting in the production of |FRAME: CPD-4205 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-monophosphate|, |FRAME: CPD-4203 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-diphosphate| and |FRAME: CPD-4201 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate|, respectively. These reactions are catalyzed by a single enzyme, |FRAME: AT1G68460-MONOMER adenylate isopentenyltransferase|. In |FRAME: TAX-3702 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>| seven IPT genes have been identified |CITS:[11313355][11479373][12734720]|.
/
/It has been shown that an enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-12015 LOG| gene removes the phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: CPD-4205 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-monophosphate|, producing |FRAME: CPD-4209 <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-dimethylallyladenine|, which can be converted to the active |FRAME: CPD-4210 <i>trans</i>-zeatin| by a single hydroxylation reaction |CITS: [17287810]|.
/
/In addition, another hydroxylase in known to act on |FRAME: CPD-4205 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-monophosphate|, |FRAME: CPD-4203 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-diphosphate| and |FRAME: CPD-4201 <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-(&Delta;<sup>2</sup>-isopentenyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate|, converting them to <i>trans</i>-zeatin ribosides |CITS:[15280363]|. Following the removal of the phosphate groups from the di- and tri-phosphate forms, the product, |FRAME: CPD-4206 <i>trans</i>-zeatin riboside monophosphate|, is converted to the active form by the |FRAME: G-12015 LOG|-encoded phosphoribohydrolase |CITS: [17287810]|.
/
/Two possible sources exist for the prenyl group: the |FRAME: PWY-922 "mevalonate pathway"| (MVA) and the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY methylerythritol phosphate pathway| (MEP). In |FRAME: TAX-3702 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>|, the plastidic MEP pathway is at the origin of the |FRAME: CPD-4210 <i>trans</i>-zeatin| species, whereas the |FRAME: CPD-4441 <i>cis</i>-zeatin| derivatives use the cytosolic MVA pathway |CITS: [14726522]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucosinolates "Glucosinolates"| are substituted &beta;-thioglucoside <i>N</i>-hydroxysulfates, formed by certain plants from any one of eight amino acids, namely, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Over 115 naturally occurring glucosinolates have been identified |CITS: [18458837]|. Much of
/the diversity amongst glucosinolates arises from the addition of different sized alkyl groups to the side chain of the amino acids, principally valine, phenylalanine and methionine. 
/
/Glucosinolates are found prominently in the order |FRAME: TAX-3700 <i>Brassicaceae</i>|, which includes cabbage, mustard, oilseed rape, broccoli, and the model plant Arabidopsis, and are responsible for the typical sharp taste and odor of these plants.
/
/The glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by the plant to compounds that are toxic to herbivores, and play an important role in plant defense. The hydrolysis of is catalyzed by |FRAME: AT5G26000-MONOMER "myrosinases"| (b-thioglucoside glucohydrolase, |FRAME: RXN-8134 "EC 3.2.1.147"| ), enzymes that are physically segregated from glucosinolates within the intact plant in specialized ''myrosin'' cells, and are brought into contact by tissue damage |CITS: [Bones96]|.
/
/The products of the myrosinase reaction are unstable aglycons, |FRAME: THIOHYDROXIMATE-O-SULFATES "thiohydroximate-O-sulfates"|, that decompose to different types of products, depending on the chemical nature of the side chain of the parent glucosinolate and the conditions of hydrolysis. Products include nitriles, isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, oxazolidine-2-thiones, and epithionitriles.
/
/Glucosinolates with an aliphatic side chain are generally hydrolyzed to yield isothiocyanates at a neutral pH. However, acidic pH or the presence of |FRAME:FE+2 Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>| ions favors the production of nitriles |CITS: [Gil80]|.
/
/In some plants, additional proteins are involved in glucosinolate hydrolysis. For example, it has been shown that the presence of an epithiospecifier protein (ESP) results in conversion of thiohydroximate-O-sulfates to bioactive nitriles or epithionitriles |CITS: [11752388]|. If the parent glucosinolate possessed a terminal alkene group, epithionitriles are formed (by transfer of the sulfur atom from the basic glucosinolate backbone to the terminal alkene residue of the side chain), whereas other glucosinolates are converted to simple nitriles. The protein appears to have no catalytic activity in the absence of myrosinase |CITS: [Daxenbichler68][4130022][MacLeod85][11752388][15845404]|. In the absence of ESP, as in some Capparales species, isothiocynates are the only breakdown products |CITS: [11752388]|.
/
/<b> About this pathway </b>: The hydrolysis products of glucosinolates are methylated to volatile sulfur compounds by five distinct isoforms of thiol methyltransferases (TMT) in |FRAME: TAX-3712 <i>Brassica oleracea</i>|. The produced sulfur volatiles play a role in anti-insect and anti-pathogen activities. The expression pattern of TMT's in cabbage correlated with the glucosinolate accumulation. These TMT's possess the methyltransferase signature in their sequence but had distinct functions from them |CITS: [12369626]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Flavonoids are secondary metabolites formed from phenylpropanoid and fatty acid derivatives and have important functions, acting as UV-B protectors |CITS:[11724379]|, attractors of pollinators and seed dispersers, insect feeding attractors, anti-feedants, signal molecules in legume-rhizobium bacteria interactions |CITS:[3738520]|, and 
/fungicides. Flavonoids have also received a lot of attention due to their effect of human health. In some plant species, flavonoids are required for fertility, but this is not the case in |FRAME:TAX-3701| |CITS:[8672888]|. 
/
/Biosynthesis is thought to occur in the cytoplasm through enzymes that are associated with the endoplasmatic reticulum membranes |CITS:[3321063]| where the enzymes form a large, macromolecular complex |CITS:[10536025]|. 
/
/The structure of the major flavonoids in |FRAME:TAX-3701| have recently been described |CITS:[10514319]|. Under greenhouse conditions, only kaempferol glycosides accumulate in |FRAME:TAX-3701|. With higher UV exposure, quercetin metabolites can be detected as well |CITS:[10514319]|. Most flavonoids accumulate in the vacuole, the cuticular wax and in the cell wall |CITS:[10975502]|.

/Flavonoids constitute a relatively diverse family of aromatic molecules that are derived from Phenylalanine and malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA; via the fatty acidic pathway). |CITS: [11402179]| There are six major subgroups found in most higher plants: the chalcones, flavones, flavonols, flavandiols, anthocyanins, and condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins); a seventh group, the aurones, are not ubiquitos. 
/
/Isoflavonoids are found mostly in legumes but also in a small number of non-legume plants and another specialized form of flavonoids, the phlobaphenes (monomers: 3-deoxyanthocyanins), have been detected in only a few species so far. Stilbenes, closely related to flavonoids, are synthesized by yet another group of unrelated species.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b> Equisetum arvense L (horsetail) grows in moist areas of temperate regions. The shoot has high levels of silicate and has been traditionally used as a cleansing agent. It is also used for a wide range of medicinal uses as it has a number of secondary metabolites that are bioactive agents|CITS: [21301385]|. The infertile shoots posses high levels of flavonoids, caffeic esters and complex glucosides. The fertile portion or the sporophyte lacks flavonoids. The equisetum flavonoids were shown to have antioxidant, germination-inhibitory and hepatoprotective effects |CITS: [20170379]|, |CITS: [20011829]|. The protoflavones;  protoapigenin and protogenkwaninare are promising anticarcinogenic agents. 
/
/This pathway shows the flavonoid biosynthesis in infertile shoots of horsetail. 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases convert flavonones, like NAR or eriodictyol, to flavones, dihydroflavonols and flavonols. The expression of flavone synthase I was demonstrated for the first time to occur in a plant taxon outside of Apiaceae |CITS: [21353683]|.

COMMENT - In addition to be a building block for protein synthesis, aspartate, along with glutamate, glutamine, and 
/asparagine are used to transport nitrogen through out the plant, and they represent 70% total free amino 
/acids in Arabidopsis. Nitrogen is first assimilated from the soil into glutamine and glutamate via 
/glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, and later into aspartate and asparagine via aspartate 
/aminotransferase and asparagine synthetase. 
/
/There are six genes in Arabidopsis that encode aspartate aminotransferase, two for the cytosolic 
/isoform (ASP2 and ASP4), two (ASP5 and AtAAT) for the chloroplast, one (ASP1) for mitochondrial, 
/and one (ASP3) for peroxisomal. ASP2 encodes the major cytosolic isoform. It is responsible for 
/synthesizing the bulk of aspartate in the light, which supplies the precursor for asparagine 
/synthesis in the dark|CITS: [12068109]|. The chloroplast, mitochondrial and peroxisomal isoforms, 
/along with malate dehydrogenase, are predicted to be involved in shuttling reducing powers 
/(NADH) between subcellular compartments via the malate-aspartate shuttle|CITS: [16623902]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME:PWY-7220| and |FRAME:PWY-7222|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The salvage of purine deoxynucleosides to deoxynucleotides is common, but not universal. For example, the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have the enzymes that phosphorylate purine deoxynucleosides to deoxynucleoside monophopsphates, and thus is not able to utilize this salvage pathway.
/
/Mammalian cells contain four principal nucleoside kinase salvage enzymes, namely deoxycytidine kinase (|FRAME: HS08100|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 "EC 2.7.1.74"|), thymidine kinases 1 and 2 (|FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 "EC 2.7.1.21"|), and deoxyguanosine kinase (|FRAME: HS03819|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.113 "EC 2.7.1.113"|). In addition, adenosine kinase (|FRAME: HS08097|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.20 "EC 2.7.1.20"|) should also be considered a deoxyribonucleoside salvage enzyme, because it is can phosphorylate |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE|, although with much lower efficiency that the other enzymes |CITS: [7494863]|.
/
/The phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in mammalian cells is mediated predominantly by two of these enzymes, the cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (|FRAME: HS08100|) and the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase (|FRAME: HS03819|). The |FRAME: CPLX-8620| is responsible for phosphorylation of purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. It phosphorylate |FRAME: DEOXYGUANOSINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYINOSINE| with high affinity (Km < 25 &mu;M) and |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE| with lower affinity (Km > 60 &mu;M) |CITS: [6295492]|.
/
/Despite of its name, |FRAME: CPLX-8618| catalyzes the phosphorylation of not only |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| but also |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYGUANOSINE| |CITS: [3030413][7494863]|.
/The enzyme can utilize either ATP or UTP as phosphoryl donors, and based on comparison of <i>in vitro</i> kinetic data of |FRAME: CPD-15099| phosphorylation by both compounds it has been suggested that UTP is the <i>in vivo</i> relevant donor |CITS: [2021937][1406603]|.
/
/While there do not appear to exist dedicated enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates to the diphosphate form, the enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of ribonucleoside monophosphates, namely adenylate kinase (|FRAME: EC-2.7.4.3 "EC 2.7.4.3"|) and guanylate kinase (|FRAME: EC-2.7.4.8 "EC 2.7.4.8"|), appear to also catalyze the reaction with the deoxynucleotides in all species studied so far |CITS: [11008000]|.
/
/Once the diphosphate forms are generated, they are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"| |CITS: [1659321][12009894]|.

CITATIONS - 16122935
CITATIONS - 16122935:EV-AS-TAS:3371234717:peifenz
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with
/several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways.
/The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates.
/The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives,
/which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references
/therein). 
/
/At least three alternative arginine biosynthetic pathways have evolved in bacteria:
/
/In the first pathway (|FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY|), which is not very common, the key intermediate
/|FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed by the enzyme |FRAME: N-ACETYLTRANSFER-CPLX|.
/A second key intermediate downstream, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|, is hydrolyzed by the
/enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX|, releasing acetate, and forming the arginine precursor
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|.
/
/In the second pathway (|FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and
/eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions mentioned above are linked: the acetyl
/group which is removed from |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto glutamate,
/regenerating  |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG).
/This recycling is performed by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-1001| (OAT). This pathway is
/considered more evolved, since the overall reaction is energetically more favorable |CITS: [3534538]|.
/
/The third pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5154|) is a variation found in several eubacteria. While in the two
/pathways mentioned above |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is deacetylate to
/|FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, which is subsequntly transcarbamylated to form |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE|,
/in this variant |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is not deacetylated. Instead, it is
/transcarbamylated directly by the enzyme acetylornithine transcarbamylase, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-7224|.
/The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX| can accept |FRAME: CPD-7224| as a substrate,
/and deacetylates it into |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| |CITS: [16585758]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The linear pathway of arginine biosynthesis has been found in the <i>Enterobacteriaceae |CITS: [3534538]|</i>,
/the |FRAME:TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME:TAX-34|
/|CITS: [ 9829957]|, and the archaeon |FRAME:TAX-2287| |CITS: [vandecasteele90]|.
/In this pathway  glutamate is acetylated to <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate (NAG) by the enzyme NAG synthase,
/encoded by the <i>argA</i> gene. The acetyl donor for this reaction is  acetyl-CoA. 
/NAG is then converted in several enzymatic steps to <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine. The acetyl
/group is removed in the form of acetate by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, encoded by the <i>argE</i>
/gene. Ornithine is then combined with carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline, which is converted in two steps to
/L-arginine.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The only unsaturated fatty acids found in |FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247|,
/comprise about one-half the fatty acid content of the organism.
/The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in |FRAME:TAX-562| with lower growth temperature,
/a phenomenon found in most organisms that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase
/transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures.
/
/|FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is the only enzyme that can catalyze the conversion of
/|FRAME: CPD-9245| to |FRAME: CPD-9247|, and is believed to play a major role in the thermal regulation
/of fatty acid composition of the membrane phospholipids of |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [6988423]|.
/|FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is one of three &beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS) in |FRAME:TAX-562|:
/|FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|,
/encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.
/
/It has been shown that |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is more active at low temperatures (relative to
/the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative
/increase results in the production of |FRAME: CPD-9247| rather than |FRAME: CPD-9245|.
/Furthermore, because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of
/|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of diunsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic
/phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|.
/
/Some plant species such as |FRAME: TAX-48545| and |FRAME: TAX-73871| (<i>Doxantha unguis-cati</i> L.) produce relatively high levels of |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247| in their seed oils |CITS: [CHISHOLMMJ60][CHISHOLMMJ65]|. The plastidal synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9247| from |FRAME: CPD-9245| via KASII is thought to be similar to that of the <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|</i> pathway (in |CITS: [20943853]|). KAS II enzymes (EC 2.3.1.179) have been characterized in |FRAME: TAX-3708| |CITS: [11442062]| and |FRAME: TAX-3562| |CITS: [6756317]|, and a |FRAME: NADH|-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase (EC 1.3.1.9) has been characterized in these and several other plant species |CITS: [6756317][1912503][7075600 ][7125663]|.

COMMENT - Brassinosteroids are steroidal hormones that regulate the growth and development of plants. Brassinosteroids are C<sub>27</sub>, C<sub>28</sub> and C<sub>29</sub> steroids depending on their C-24 alkyl substituents. More than 50 free, naturally occurring brassinosteroids have been identified in plants, of which brassinolide (BL) is the most biologically active C<sub>28</sub>, and together with its C<sub>28</sub> congeners, is distributed widely in the plant kingdom |CITS:[15012241]|. The biosynthesis pathway of brassinolide was initially elucidated using cultured <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> cells. Extensive metabolic studies suggested parallel-branched brassinolide pathways, namely the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways |CITS:[14502988]|. It has been proposed that the late C-6 oxidation pathway plays a predominant role in the light, whereas the early C-6 oxidation pathway is dominant in the dark (see |FRAME:PWY-699 brassinosteroid biosynthesis I|) |CITS: [10982435]|. Recent studies suggest that there is a crosstalk between these parallel pathways, implying that they are not totally autonomous. The operation of an early C-22 oxidation branch of the brassinosteroid biosynthetic pathway has also been demonstrated |CITS:[12376657]|.
/
/The existence of this alternative biosynthesis branch has been postulated from the study of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> <i>sax1</i> and <i>det2</i> mutants. This novel bypass pathway is composed of C22-hydroxylated compounds. The <i>sax1</i> phenotype could be rescued by application of synthetic 22&alpha;-hydroxy-campest-4-en-3-one and 22&alpha;-hydroxy-5&alpha;-campestan-3-one. These compounds have since been detected <i>in planta</i> |CITS:[12376657], [11489171]|. This C22&alpha;-hydroxy pathway seems to be active in the dark as, under those conditions, its compounds can also phenotypically restore <i>dwf4</i> and <i>det2</i> |CITS: [10377996]|.
/
/The Arabidopsis DWF4 which encodes a CYP90B1 monooxygenase was subsequently cloned. In vitro kinetic analysis showed that the Km value for campesterol was 9 times lower than that for campestanol, and that the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) for campesterol was 325 times higher than that for campestanol |CITS: [16460510]|. In Arabidopsis seedlings, the concentration of campesterol was found to be 58 times higher than that of campestanol. Taken together it suggests that campesterol is the major substrate of CYP90B1 and that the C-22 hydroxylation branch is the main route of brassinosteroid biosynthesis in plants (at least in Arabidopsis) |CITS: [16460510]|.
/
/Additional shortcuts by C-23 hydroxylation have also been detected recently |CITS: [17138693]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  The acid sugar 3-deoxy-D-<i>manno</i>-octulosonate (KDO), in addition to being an important component of the lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, is also a component of the rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII) pectin fraction of the primary cell walls of most higher plants, including dicots, monocots and gymnosperms |CITS:[7958328],[9779594],[York85],[shin97]|.  To date, the specific contribution of KDO to RGII function, as well as the pathway leading to the synthesis, activation and incorporation of KDO into this polysaccharide remain largely unknown.  In order to be incorporated into cell wall polymers, KDO requires to be activated; free KDO cannot be directly incorporated.  This activation occurs through the unusual coupling of KDO to the monophosphonucleotide CMP, rather than to the more common diphosphonucleotides |CITS:[11050325]|.
/
/<b>Enzymatic steps:</b>  The first two steps of this pathway deal with the formation of KDO from D-arabinose 5-phosphate.  The first reaction is catalyzed by a family of genes called KDOPS (3-deoxy-D-<i>manno</i>-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase).  The bacterial KDOPSs are grouped in two classes: Class I and Class II.  It has been proposed that the plant KDOPSs belong to a third class (stable against thermal denaturation, dimeric and non-metallo-enzymes) |CITS:[15070398]|.  No plant enzymes have yet been shown to catalyze reaction EC 3.1.3.45 |CITS:[15070398]|.  The last step of the pathway corresponds to the activation step of KDO.  This step is catalyzed by a 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase called CMP-KDO synthetase (CKS).  To date the only characterized representative of plant CKSs is the maize ZmCKS |CITS:[10829033]|.
/
/<b>Note on this pathway variant:</b>  This pathway is almost identical to its bacterial variant (|FRAME:PWY-1269|).  The difference lies in the first step.  Indeed, in plants (represented in this pathway), the origin of D-arabinose 5-phosphate is unknown and it was therefore judged inappropriate to include the isomerisation step of D-ribulose 5-phosphate into D-arabinose 5-phosphate in this pathways.  This conversion, however, has not been disproved; but remains to be ascertained in plants.

COMMENT - Abscisic acid was initially thought to induce abscission of leaves. Now, however, abscission is known to be regulated by ethylene. Accumulation of ABA during seed development has been associated with maturation of the seed, development of desiccation tolerance and suppression of vivipary. Rapid increases of ABA has also been linked to water stress-induced closure of stomata. (Buchanan et al, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants)
/In plants, abscisic acid is synthesized from neoxanthin by the action of a dioxygenase. In certain bacteria, it is synthesized as a C15 terpenoid (sesquiterpene).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found 
/in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. It is a porphyrin member of 
/the cyclic tetrapyrroles. It is biosynthesized as protoheme, but different derivatives of protoheme can be formed 
/that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as for instance in 
/|FRAME: HEME_O| or |FRAME: HEME_D|. 
/
/The protoheme biosynthetic pathway shown here for plants is generally found in archae and some bacteria 
/(including |FRAME: ECOLI|) |CITS: [13680202]| |CITS: [12177321]| |CITS: [16093570]|. In all these organisms 
/the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway starts with glutamate (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|). Plants biosynthesize 
/heme and compounds derived from heme via glutamate for various biological functions such as photosynthetic

/The difference in expression pattern and localization between the two ferrochelatases has been interpreted 
/as a division of the corresponding function. FC1 has been shown to be co-expressed with the entry enzyme 
/of the |FRAME:PWY-5188|, i.e. glutamyl-tRNA reductase (HEMA2) and is involved under normal conditions

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:PHE Phenylalanine| is one of the three proteinogenic aromatic amino acids produced only in plants and microorganisms which represents a central metabolite to which a major portion (~30%) of the carbon flux from photosynthesis is being directed |CITS:[22554242]|. Moreover, |FRAME:PHE| is precursor for a plethora of compounds which have been shown to be involved in plant defense (flavonoids - |CITS:[11743081] [22404468]|), signaling and protection (isoflavonoids - |CITS:[12644640] [20921162]|), reproduction (phenylpropanoids and volatiles - |CITS:[20035037]|) and general plant fitness (e.g. vitamin E - |FRAME:PWY-1422|; plastoquinone - |FRAME:PWY-1581|; suberin - |FRAME:PWY-1121|). 
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME:PHE| has been known to comprise two major pathways, the pathway in plants via |FRAME:CPD-659| |CITS:[20215586] [17726025]| and the pathway via |FRAME:PHENYL-PYRUVATE| utilized in microbes |CITS:[15753077]|. The plant pathway has been claimed to occur exclusively in plastids (reviewed in |CITS:[22554242]|). 
/
/However, this all-plastidal paradigm was challenged when a cytosolic aromatic amino acid transaminase (PPY-AT) was detected in <i>Petunia x hybrida</i> which significantly contributed to the cellular |FRAME:PHE| biosynthesis. The PPY-AT was shown to exhibit an unusual substrate preference for |FRAME:TYR| as amino donor and |FRAME:PHENYL-PYRUVATE| as substrate forming |FRAME:PHE| and |FRAME:P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE|. Although PPY-AT also could utilize |FRAME:GLT| for |FRAME:PHE| formation the catalytic efficiency was clearly lower. The tyrosine:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase also catalyzed the corresponding reverse reactions with both co-substrates, i.e. |FRAME:P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE| and |FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE|, respectively but with considerably less activity. The new cytosolic aromatic amino acid transaminase step was discussed as mediator for the interconnection of |FRAME:TYR| catabolismus and |FRAME:PHE| anabolismus which will add another level of complexity to |FRAME:PHE| metabolism in plants |CITS:[24270997]|. The exactly same forward and reverse reactions were also carried out by a <i>Cucumis melo</i> aromatic amino acid transaminase |CITS:[24270997]| which had been previously reported to be involved in the formation of |FRAME:PHE|-derived volatiles in melon |CITS:[20065117]|.    
/
/The generated |FRAME:P-HYDROXY-PHENYLPYRUVATE| produced in the forward reaction with |FRAME:PHENYL-PYRUVATE| and |FRAME:TYR| has been proposed to be involved in the formation of |FRAME:HOMOGENTISATE| which in turn for example feeds into vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols) biosynthesis (e.g. |FRAME:PWY-7436|) |CITS:[24270997]|. The preceding enzymatic step in the pathway converting |FRAME:PREPHENATE| to |FRAME:PHENYL-PYRUVATE| catalyzed by prephenyl dehydratase (PDT) remains to be elucidated although the catalytic activity was observed in extracts from <i>Petunia</i> petals |CITS:[24270997]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Bacteria, fungi, and plants produce ethylene. In plants, ethylene is an important hormone that regulates plant growth 
/and development.  It is well-known as a fruit-ripening hormone and is biologically active in trace amounts. Ethylene 
/also plays a general role as a growth inhibitor in promoting leaf and flower senescence and abscission. 
/
/In plants, methionine is the only known precursor of ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene is synthesized from methionine through intermediates S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and 
/aminocyclopropane-carboxylate (ACC). Ethylene synthesis can be induced by environmental stress and other plant growth hormones such as auxin. Its production and action can be inhibited by specific ethylene inhibitors such as silver and high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>.

TYPES - O-Antigen-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - UDP-&alpha;-D-glucuronate biosynthesis (from UDP-glucose)
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is a common compound found in all kingdoms of life.
/In some Gram-negative bacteria it is a precursor for synthesis of the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, a component of the outer membrane |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides| (see |FRAME: PWY-7328|), or of cell wall components such as |FRAME: CPD0-1099| (see |FRAME: COLANSYN-PWY|). In some Gram-positive bacteria it is involved in the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide |CITS:[7929009]|.
/
/In plants a large amount of the cell-wall biomass is derived from |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| through the complex interconversion of nucleotide sugars (for review see |CITS:[15134748]|). |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is converted to a number of other sugars including |FRAME: UDP-D-GALACTURONATE|, |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| and |FRAME: CPD-12513| (see |FRAME: PWY-5114|), which form diverse plant cell wall |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| polymers.
/
/In animals |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is an intermediate in the synthesis of |FRAME: ASCORBATE| by certain organsisms (see |FRAME: PWY3DJ-35471| and |FRAME: PWY-6415|). The other anomeric form, |FRAME: CPD-12521|, is found in |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycan| side chains of proteoglycan core proteins and polymers, such as |FRAME: Hyaluronan| and |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates|. It is also the substrate for liver glucuronosyltransferases that glucuronidate xenobiotics and some endogenous compounds in an important pathway for the metabolism of toxins and drugs. The resulting glucuronides are rapidly excreted through the biliary tract or kidneys (in |CITS: [9737970]|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The most common route for formation of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is by the hydroxylation of |FRAME: CPD-12575|, catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.22|. A second route has been observed in plants, starting with the polyol |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-4841|).

TYPES - Pyrimidine-Nucleotide-Salvage
COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine ribonucleosides salvage I
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in this salvage pathway is uridine-cytidine kinase (also known as uridine kinase, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.48 "EC 2.7.1.48"|). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the nucleosides |FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to their monophosphate forms.
/
/The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, plants and animals, although some differences exists among the enzymes. For example, the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-562| prefers GTP as the phosphate donor |CITS: [211379]|, while the mammalian enzyme prefers ATP. The enzymes from |FRAME: TAX-3702| are dual-domain proteins, with the second domain resembling |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "EC 2.4.2.9, uracil phosphoribosyltransferase"|, although they were shown to lack such activity |CITS: [19563437]|.
/
/Another enzyme that participates in the salvage of nucleosides is cytidine deaminase (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.5 "EC 3.5.4.5"|). It has been shown in |FRAME: TAX-562| that exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is not directly converted to CMP. Instead, a very active |FRAME: CYTIDEAM-CPLX| converts it rapidly to |FRAME: URIDINE|, which is phosphorylated to UMP, and eventually converted to UTP and CTP. However, exogenously supplied cytidine will be phosphorylated to CMP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.
/
/This pathway was shown to be the exclusive pyrimidine ribonucleoside salvage pathway operating in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Sanguinarine and macarpine belong to a subgroup of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids known as benzophenanthridines that are derived from (S)-reticuline via (S)-scoulerine. While several benzylisoquinoline-producing species are known to accumulate sanguinarine, the best-studied organisms include Eschscholzia californica (California poppy), Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) and Sanguinaria canadensis, or (bloodroot), due to the red pigmentation of the roots of this plant as a result of sanguinarine accumulation. In cell suspension cultures of these plants, sanguinarine biosynthesis is inducible with the addition of fungal elicitors. Many of the enzymes involved in the sanguinarine/macarpine biosynthesic pathway were identified and characterized using elicited plant cell cultures. The toxicity of sanguinarine and related alkaloids suggests that they are involved in plant defense against herbivores and microbes. Sanguinarine also exhibits anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial effects that are useful to humans. It has been widely used in toothpastes and mouth washes due to its anti-microbial activity.
/
/Various enzymes from different plants catalyzing the the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge of |FRAME:S-SCOULERINE|, |FRAME:S-CHEILANTHIFOLINE| (this pathway) and |FRAME:S-TETRAHYDROCOLUMBAMINE| (see |FRAME:PWY-3901|) |CITS:[17250743] [21094631]| also catalyze the formation of |FRAME:S-TETRAHYDROBERBERINE| which was once discussed as an possible intermediate towards |FRAME:S-STYLOPINE|. However, this assumption could not be corroborated |CITS:[Bauer91]| and it remains an open question whether or not |FRAME:S-TETRAHYDROBERBERINE| is part of a metabolic side-step towards |FRAME:S-STYLOPINE| or branch point towards other plant alkaloids.

COMMENT - Phytochromes are photoreceptors that respond to red and far-red light in photosynthetic organisms. Phytochromes are dimeric proteins with each monomer covalently attached with a bilin chromophore |CITS: [16387836], [20534495]|. The plant bilin chromophore (3E)-phytochromobilin is synthesized from heme in the chloroplast. The assembly of phytochrome occurs in the cytoplasm. 
/
/The committed step in phytochromobilin biosynthesis is catalyzed by heme oxygenase (HO). Although HOs with other regiospecificities were known from bacteria and insects, the Arabidopsis HOs were shown to only produce biliverdin (BV) IX<sub>alpha</sub> isomer from heme |CITS: [19860740]|. BV is subsequently reduced in plants to (3Z)- and (3E)-phytochromobilin |CITS: [7744741]|.  It's not clear whether the isomerization of (3Z) to (3E)-phytochromobilin is enzyme catalyzed or spontaneous. Different BV reductases with unique double bond specificities found in different organisms divert BV to distinct end products, such as bilirubin in mammals, phycocyanobilin and phycoerythrobilin in cyanobacteria and red algae, and phytochromobilin in plants and green algae |CITS: [11283349]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: |FRAME:ARG| is an essential protein amino acid which is involved in a variety of vital cellular and developmental functions and is metabolized in several pathways, e.g. in the urea cycle (this pathway). Arginine contributes to the biosynthesis of polyamines (compare |FRAME:PWYQT-94|), represents a storage and transport form of nitrogen and is a precursor for the formation of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) (see |FRAME:PWY-4983|) |CITS:[13958361]|. It has been shown that in plants arginine embodies the highest amount of free amino acid nitrogen which can reach up to 50% in developing seedlings |CITS:[16666818]|. In this cycle urea is formed from two amino groups stemming from arginine and ammonia. In comparison to ammonia urea is a rather nontoxic compound and may serve as storage compound for recyclable nitrogen.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Most but not all enzymes involved in the urea cycle have been characterized in plants. While information about argininosuccinate synthase and carbamoyl phosphate synthase (ammonia) remains sparse the three residual enzymes, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, argininosuccinate lyase and arginase have been distinguished in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
/
/The cDNA encoding for ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) catalyzing the formation of citrulline has been identified from a T-DNA-tagged mutant |CITS: [10561504]| and the argininosuccinate lyase, the enzyme that reversibly converts argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate has been partially purified from Arabidopsis |CITS:[17651442]|. The last step in the pathway the hydrolyzation of arginine to form ornithine under the liberation of urea is catalyzed by arginase. The enzymatic activity has bee confirmed by functional complementation of an arginase-deficient yeast mutant |CITS:[7770544]|. Arginase has been localized to mitochondria in soybean |CITS:[10787060]| which is also expected to be the case for other plants. Therefore arginine must enter the mitochondrion for further metabolization (e.g. arginase), and the resulting ornithine is exported from this organelle indicating the existence of amino acid transporters involved in the pathway. Recently mitochondrial transporters specific for arginine have been found and characterized in Arabidopsis supporting the current view of the pathway |CITS:[16730327]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The glycolysis pathway represented here is also known as the '<i>Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway</i>'.  First identified in yeast cells and mammalian tissue, it is now also seen as the 'central' metabolic pathway in plants, and can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.  Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions: i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.  The ultimate purpose of the pathway is to convert carbon in its reduced form in storage carbohydrates (e.g. glycogen, |FRAME:Starch| and simpler carbohydrates such as |FRAME:SUCROSE|, |FRAME:D-Glucose| and |FRAME:D-Galactose|).  In plants, glycolysis is the predominant pathway fueling respiration (see |FRAME:PWY-5690|) because, unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria rarely respire fatty acids. In plants, this pathway occurs in two different subcellular locations: the cytosol and plastids, which are the sites of |FRAME:PWY-621| and |FRAME:PWY-6724 starch degradation|, respectively.  Whereas the <i>plastidic</i> glycolysis pathway (this pathway) is identical to the conventional microbial glycolysis, the <i>cytosolic</i> pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-1042|) is slightly modified.  These pathways can interact with one another though the action of highly selective transporters present in the inner plastid envelope |CITS:[Emes93]|.  In chloroplasts in the dark, as well as in plastids of non-photosynthetic tissues, the primary function of |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS| is the degradation of |FRAME:Starch| to generate carbon skeletons, reductants and ATP for anabolic pathways such as that of |FRAME:PWY-4381| via |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|.  In the cytosol, the same products are generated from the degradation of |FRAME:SUCROSE| via |FRAME:PWY-1042|. In developing oil seeds, phosphoenoylpyruvate derived from |FRAME:PWY-1042| is transported from the cytosol to plastids, where it is further converted to pyruvate then acetyl-CoA to fuel fatty acid and oil biosynthesis|CITS: [17892448][17557808]|.  
/
/The pathway starts with |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, which is made available from a variety of sources (in the plant plastids, it results from |FRAME:PWY-842|).  The first committed step of glycolysis is the reversible conversion of |FRAME:GLC-6-P| into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| by an hexose phosphate isomerase, which changes the pyranose configuration of glucose into the furanose configuration of fructose.  The second step is catalyzed by a phosphofructokinase in the presence of |FRAME:ATP|; this step is irreversible (in the cytosol of plants, see |FRAME:PWY-621|, an alternative enzyme uses |FRAME:PPI| instead of ATP).  The third step is catalyzed by an aldolase which cleaves |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE| into interconvertable (they are keto-enol tautomers) two three-carbon fragments: |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|.  The interconversion of these tautomers is facilitated by a triose phosphate isomerase.  The following reaction, which adds one phosphate residue to |FRAME:GAP| to form |FRAME:DPG|, is freely reversible and requires |FRAME:NAD| and |FRAME:Pi|.  The next step releases one molecule of ATP during the conversion of |FRAME:DPG| into |FRAME:G3P| by a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate kinase.  The next step requires little energy change and leads to the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from the 3- to the 2-hydroxyl group of glycerate, leading to the formation of |FRAME:2-PG|.  The removal of a molecule of water by an enolase in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> converts |FRAME:2-PG| into |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| (PEP).  The final step of glycolysis involves the ketolization of PEP to |FRAME:PYRUVATE| by a pyruvate kinase, leading to the release of a molecule of ATP.
/
/<b>Note on the sucrose-starch relationship:</b>  Sucrose and starch biosyntheses are compartmentalized.  Sucrose is synthesized in the cytosol, whereas starch is produced in the plastids.  The two metabolic route intersect however at the level of |FRAME:G3P|, which can be translocated across the chloroplast membrane via a 3PGA/<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> translocator |CITS:[AVIGAD97]|.

COMMENT - Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an important antioxidant and an enzyme cofactor. Higher plants and higher animals 
/(but not humans) can synthesize ascorbate. Plants provide the major dietary vitamin C source for humans. 
/The plant ascorbate biosynthesis pathways have only been recently proposed. They differ from what was found in 
/mammals. 
/
/<B>About the different routes of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants:</B>
/
/The existence of alternative routes in plants and the contribution of each route to ascorbate biosynthesis in vivo 
/have been under debate. Wheeler et al originally proposed a so called linear L-galactose pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-882|) that will require 
/PMI (phosphomannose isomerase), PMM (phosphomannomutase) and VTC1 (GDP-D-mannose 
/pyrophosphorylase) among the others |CITS:[9620799]|. The failure of detecting PMI activity in many plants in the 
/past has prompted the search for alternative routes and the subsequent proposal of the L-gulose 
/pathway (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-11|) |CITS:[12954627]|, VTC2 cycle (depicted here) |CITS:[17485667]|, and extended VTC2 
/cycle (see |FRAME: PWY4FS-13|) |CITS:[17950389]|. However, the recent detection of PMI activity in Arabidopsis, the lower ascorbate 
/contents observed in a PMI silencing line of tobacco, and conversely the higher ascorbate contents obtained in a 
/PMI over-expressing line, and the lower ascorbate levels in the Arabidopsis VTC1 mutants all argue in favor of the 
/linear L-galactose pathway (reviewed in |CITS:[18824398]|). 
/
/Another controversial is on VTC2/VTC5. Two activities of VTC2 have been reported, GDP-L-galactose 
/phosphorylase and GDP-L-galactose: hexose-1-P guanylyltransferase. One study suggested the major activity of 
/VTC2 being the guanylyltransferase activity |CITS:[17485667]|, whereas another study suggested phosphorylase being the 
/major activity of VTC2 |CITS:[17462988]|. The guanylyltransferase 
/activity is critical for the VTC2 cycle and the extended VTC2 cycle. Nonetheless, both activities lead to the 
/formation of L-galactose-1-P, an intermediate in the L-galactose pathway. Arabidopsis double mutants of 
/VTC2/VTC5 are seedling lethal, which can be rescued by 
/supplementation with L-galactose |CITS:[17877701]|. It demonstrates that the L-galactose pathway is a critical 
/source of ascorbate, at least in Arabidopsis.  
/
/The extended VTC2 cycle, includes an extra yet unidentified enzyme in comparison with the VTC2 cycle. The 
/putative GDP-D-mannose 2"-epimerase catalyzes the reversible conversion of GDP-D-glucose to 
/GDP-D-mannose. GDP-D-glucose, that can be formed by VTC2, strongly inhibits the 
/GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase, another enzyme in the VTC2 cycle. Thus, the conversion of the "toxic" 
/GDP-D-glucose by the extended VTC2 cycle puts the pathway in favor over the original VTC2 
/cycle (reviewed in |CITS:[17950389]|). In addition, the extended VTC2 cycle can make direct use of D-glucose-1-P which is derived from photosynthesis.   
/
/The intermediate GDP-sugars in ascorbate biosynthesis are also substrates for cell wall polysaccharides and 
/protein glycosylation.

COMMENT - Flavonoids are a class of plant secondary metabolites widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Over 10,000 flavonoids have been 
/described in the literature |CITS: [17587669]|. They display important functions as attractants for pollinators,  protective agents 
/against UV light and various pathogens,  antibiotics, and  signal molecules involved in symbiosis with Rhizobia. Apart from their biological functions, they are also known for their antioxidant and anticancer and other bioactivities in humans. 
/
/Flavonoids are usually found as water-soluble glycosides. However, the occurrence of methoxylated, acylated or sulfated derivatives 
/of flavonoids have also been reported in plants. The presence of over 80 different flavonoids sulfates has been reported from various plant species 
/|CITS: [Barron88]|.  
/
/Enzymatic sulfonation of flavonoids is catalyzed by a family of sulfotransferases (STs) that transfer the sulfonate group of 
/|FRAME:PAPS | to the hydroxyl group of a flavonoid to produce a sulfate flavonoid ester.

COMMENT - Cellulose is present universally in the cell walls of plants. It accounts for about 20% (by weight) of the primary cell walls 
/and about 50% of the secondary cell walls. The primary structure of cellulose is a linear array of D-glucose joined by 
/beta (1,4) glycosyl linkage. The biosynthesis of cellulose is catalyzed by the cellulose synthase enzyme complex which 
/is visualized as rosettes located in the plasma membrane. It is proposed that each rosette is composed of six subunits, and 
/each rosette subunit in turn is composed of 6 cellulose synthases. Each individual cellulose synthase catalyzes the formation 
/of one glucan chain which then associates with neighbor chains of the same rosette to form cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [12514238]|.
/ In Arabidopsis, at least six cellulose synthase genes were shown to be required in cellulose synthesis. CesA1, 
/CesA3, and CesA6 are involved in cellulose biosynthesis in the primary walls. CesA4, CesA7, and CesA8 are involved 
/in cellulose synthesis in the secondary walls. Mutant and mutant complementation analysis indicate that these isoforms 
/of cellulose synthase are not functionally redundant. UDP-glucose channeled from sucrose degradation is the substrate
/ for cellulose synthesis.
/
/It was hypothesized that cellulose synthesis needs a primer. Recent work in cotton has shown that 
/sitosterol-beta-glucose can serve as a primer. UDP-glucose can be used to form sterol cellodextrins from 
/sitosterol-beta-glucose, presumably catalyzed by a cellulose synthase  |CITS: [11778054]|. 
/
/In addition to cellulose synthase, endo-1,4-beta-glucanase is also required in cellulose biosynthesis. It is possibly 
/involved in trimming off defective glucans from the growing microfibrils, or cleaving off the sitosterol-beta-glucose 
/primer from the growing glucan chains |CITS: [11351091]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/
/|FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE| (phytate, phytic acid) is one of the most prevalent forms of phosphorylated inositols in the eukaryotic cell, with a total concentration of 15-100 &mu;M |CITS:[3426614][1684044][8435066]|. It's cellular distribution is not completely known - some of it is soluble, some is "wall-papered" around membranes, while some is bound to proteins |CITS: [9838040]|. In plant seeds, large amount of phytate are complexed with cations and deposited as globular inclusions in membrane-bound storage bodies |CITS: [15700415]|.
/
/The compound has been proposed to have a number of signaling roles, including regulation of insulin exocytosis |CITS: [9114007]|, regulation of nuclear mRNA export |CITS:[10390371][10683435]|, binding of the clathrin assembly proteins AP2 and AP3 |CITS: [1849645][1371119]|, inhibition of clathrin cage assembly |CITS: [7814377][7829485]|, and inhibition of serine and threonine protein phosphatases that are thought to regulate L-type Ca2+ channels |CITS: [9334307]|.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In plant cells phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth. It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with different cations, including |FRAME: K+|, |FRAME: MG+2|, |FRAME: CA+2|, |FRAME: FE+2|, and |FRAME: ZN+2|, known as phytin |CITS:[11590064][8744268]|.
/Although phytin only makes up about 1% of the seed weight, it may contain up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus |CITS:[15700415]|. Phytate is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions in smaller quantities |CITS:[14568069]|. 
/
/One phytate biosynthetic pathway found in plants proceeds from |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| (produced by phospholipase C) as described in |FRAME: PWY-6361| by a series of successive phosphorylations carried out by only two enzymes.
/
/A second, indirect pathway, has been suggested to occur via |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-3-4-TRIPHOSPHATE|. The pathway is indirect because |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-3-4-TRIPHOSPHATE| itself is produced from  |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-6364|). However, once formed, |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-3-4-TRIPHOSPHATE| can be phosphorylated by |FRAME: AT5G16760-MONOMER| (|FRAME: AT5G16760|), an enzyme that does not recognize  |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| as substrate |CITS: [14568069]|. The products of |FRAME: AT5G16760| are then phosphorylated further by the same enzymes used in |FRAME: PWY-6361|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Biotin-dependent carboxylases constitute a group of enzymes with many common features in structure
/and mechanism |CITS: [Wood77]|. These enzymes have been identified in prokaryotic and eukaryotic
/organisms. Some members of this family include |FRAME:CPLX-6282 acetyl-CoA carboxylase|, |FRAME:CPLX-5203 propionyl-CoA carboxylase|, |FRAME:MONOMER-9201 pyruvate decarboxylase| 
/and the |FRAME: TAX-1744 <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</i>| transcarboxylase |CITS: [8366018]|. These enzymes are involved in various metabolic reactions such as lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism.
/Another group of bioin-dependent enzymes are the decarboxylases mediating sodium transport |CITS: [2896195]| (for an example, see |FRAME: CPLX-7676 biotin-dependent malonate decarboxylase| from |FRAME: TAX-57040 <i>Malonomonas rubra</i>|).
/
/The different biotin-dependent enzymes have different architectures in different organisms. For example, eukaryotic acetyl-CoA carboxylases contain three functional modules in one large polypeptide (biotin carboxylase/biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein/carboxyltransferase), eukaryotic propionyl-CoA-carboxylases and bifunctional acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylases of <i>Mycobacteria</i> are composed of a coupled biotin carboxylase/biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein polypeptide and separate carboxyltransferase proteins, while all the subunits of <i>E. coli</i> acetyl-CoA carboxylase exist as single proteins |CITS: [8102604][7909542][8772169]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX acetyl-CoA carboxylase| is one of the key enzymes in the
/biosynthesis of fatty acids (see |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY superpathway of fatty acid biosynthesis initiation (E. coli)|).
/The |FRAME: TAX-83333 <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12| enzyme complex is composed of two catalytic units and one carrier protein,
/encoded by four different genes.
/The catalytic units are |FRAME:BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX biotin carboxylase| (BC), a homodimer encoded by the
/|FRAME: EG10276 accC| gene, and |FRAME:ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX acetyl-CoA carboxylase| (ACCT), an
/&alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> tetramer, encoded by the |FRAME:EG11647 accA| and
/|FRAME: EG10217 accD| genes.
/The carrier protein is the |FRAME:BCCP-CPLX "biotin carboxyl carrier protein"| (BCCP), a homodimer encoded by the
/|FRAME:EG10275 accB| gene.
/
/The BCCP monomer is biotinylated by the enzyme |FRAME:BIOTINLIG-ENZRXN biotin-[acetyl-CoA-carboxylase] ligase|.
/Following dimerization of the biotinylated monomers, |FRAME:BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX biotin carboxylase| (BC) catalyzes
/the addition of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE CO<SUB>2</SUB>| to the carrier protein dimer, forming
/|FRAME:Carboxybiotin-BCCP a carboxylated-biotinylated-BCCP| (carboxy-BCCP).
/|FRAME:Carboxybiotin-BCCP a carboxylated-biotinylated-BCCP| in turn is the substrate for ACCT, which transfers the carboxy group to
/|FRAME:ACETYL-COA acetyl-CoA|, resulting in the formation of |FRAME:MALONYL-COA malonyl-CoA| and the regeneration of
/|FRAME:BCCP-CPLX biotin carboxyl carrier protein (dimer)|.
/Both biotinylation and carboxylation of the carrier protein require ATP, while the last step, transfer of the
/carboxy group to |FRAME: ACETYL-COA acetyl-CoA|, does not |CITS: [15749055]|.

COMMENT - Plants serve as nutritional sulfur sources for animals. In higher plants, sulfur metabolism starts with 
/sulfate which is acquired from soil by plant roots. The uptake of sulfate into roots and subsequent 
/transport to leaves are mediated by sulfate transporter(s). Sulfate must be reduced before it can be 
/incorporated into organic compounds. The reduction of sulfate to sulfide involves several intermediates.  
/First, sulfur is activated to APS (adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate). Next, the activated form, APS, 
/enters either the reductive sulfate assimilation pathway involving APS reductase and sulfite reductase, 
/or the sulfation pathway involving APS kinase. The sulfation pathway is a minor pathway for sulfate 
/assimilation. Its product PAPS is used as a sulfuryl donor in sulfotransferase reactions where a sulfate 
/group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond. One example is the biosynthesis of 
/glucosinolates.   
/
/In the reductive assimilation pathway, sulfide is incorporated into cysteine, and later into methionine (|FRAME: PWY-702|), which are 
/the two major sulfur-containing organic compounds in plants.
/
/<B>Interesting points of the pathway enzymes:</B>
/OAS thiol-lyase (OAS-TL) and serine acetyltransferase (SAT) can form an enzyme complex and the formation of the complex is thought to play an important role in enzyme regulation. In the complex form, SAT activity is high, whereas OAS-TL activity is low. When the complex dissociates, SAT becomes inactive and OAS-TL is more active. The formation of the complex is regulated by the concentration of OAS (O-acetylserine) and sulfide, where OAS triggers the dissociation of the complex and sulfide counteracts the effect of OAS. When sulfur supply is available, the enzyme complex forms and more OAS accumulate by active SAT. OAS is subsequently converted to cysteine by free, unbound OAS-TL which is in excess supply in the cell. When the plant is under deficient sulfur supply, OAS accumulates as a result. OAS triggers the dissociation of the complex and SAT becomes inactive to ensure no additional OAS is generated.
/
/<B>Regulation of the pathway:</B>
/In addition to the above mentioned enzyme regulation mechanism, sulfate assimilation is developmentally regulated. The highest activities of sulfate assimilation enzymes are found in growing tissues including young leaves and root tips where there is a high demand for cysteine and metionine for protein biosynthesis. The pathway is also regulated by supply of the reductants, glutathione for APS reductase and ferredoxin for sulfite reductase. In photosynthetic leaves, photosynthesis is the ultimate source of electrons. In leaves, the activity of sulfite reductase was shown directly linked to circadian phasing. Gene expression of sulfate assimilation enzymes is also found induced by sulfur deficiency conditions, exposure of plants to heavy metals, and oxidative stress.

COMMENT - Lignin is a three dimensional polymer of phenylpropanoid alcohols (monolignols). Lignin is always associated with cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose, 
/and provides mechanical rigidity to plant-supporting and plant-conducting tissues. There are three monolignols, p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. 
/The relative amounts of these monolignols found in lignin show plant specificity. Gymnosperm lignins contain mainly coniferyl alcohol, angiosperm lignins contain both 
/coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, whereas all three types of monolignols are found within lignins of grasses. The transport of monolignols to the cell wall and their lignification 
/to lignin is poorly understood.  These events possibly involve glucosylation. Lignification is possibly catalyzed by peroxidase.
/In the past decade, the lignin biosynthesis pathway has been redrawn several times based on new genetic and biochemical evidences. The pathway depicted here only illustrates 
/the major routes to lignin monomers.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-183 Gallate| is an essential precursor for many plant secondary metabolites, particularly |FRAME: HYDROLYZED-TANNIN "hydrolyzable tannins| such as gallo- and ellagitannins |CITS: [11423141]|. Both plants and fungi produce high concentrations of gallate |CITS: [9325260]|, while bacteria are known to produce small amounts.
/
/An early intermediate of the shikimate pathway, |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE 3-dehydroshikimate|, has been implicated as a potential precursor for gallate synthesis in plants |CITS: [15474568]|. A careful study has revealed that gallate is formed from |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE 3-dehydroshikimate| by the action of |FRAME: AT3G06350-MONOMER shikimate dehydrogenase|, a multifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes the reversible reduction of |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE 3-dehydroshikimate| to |FRAME: SHIKIMATE shikimate| |CITS: [Muir11]|. In the presence of NADPH the enzyme catalyzes reduction of |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE 3-dehydroshikimate|, and in the presence of NADP+ it catalyzes its oxidation to |FRAME: CPD-13085 3,5-didehydroshikimate|, an unstable compound that undergoes a spontaeous and rapid rearrangement to |FRAME: CPD-183 gallate|.
/
/This observation has been confirmed by several methods. Overexpression of cloned shikimate dehydrogenase from |FRAME: TAX-51240 <i>Juglans regia</i>| in |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>| resulted in increase of over 500% in the accumulation of gallate. In addition, shikimate dehydrogenase enzymes that were purified from several plants, as well as the bacterium <i>E. coli</i>, were shown to produce gallate <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [Muir11]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Thiaminase II activity has been observed in bacteria |CITS:[15709744]| and fungi, more specifically in cell free extracts of |FRAME:TAX-4932| |CITS:[3305065]| but its physiological role remained unresolved for a long time. In bacteria a thiamin salvage pathway has been reported in which the key enzyme thiaminase II (TenA) catalyzed the hydrolysis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and thiamine analogs to form |FRAME:HMP|. The latter represents a precursor for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| and its phosphorylated derivatives (see |FRAME:PWY-6899|)  |CITS:[17618314] [17637774]|.
/
/|FRAME:TAX-4932| employs an enzyme, i.e. THI20p which is characterized by unique properties, namely the display of both |FRAME:THIAMINE| biosynthetic and degradation activities in one fusion protein. THI20 encodes a trifunctional protein which exhibits HMP kinase (EC 2.7.1.49) and HMP-P kinase (EC 2.7.4.7) from a dimeric structure of the N-terminal domain and thiaminase II activity (EC 3.5.99.2) from a dimeric structure of the C-terminal domain linked together through a loop and a short helix |CITS:[15967475] [21904031]|. Utilizing various mutant strains of yeast devoid of one or more activities of the trifunctional enzyme it could be shown that the thiaminase II activity was not required for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of |FRAME:THIAMINE| but was rather involved in the salvage of |FRAME:THIAMINE| |CITS:[18028398]|.  The |FRAME:THIAMINE| degrading capacity of thiaminase II had been demonstrated in yeast |CITS:[15967475]| (this pathway) but THI20p was also able to hydrolyze |FRAME:THIAMINE| analogs such as |FRAME:CPD-13578| (see |FRAME:PWY-6899|) or |FRAME:CPD-15776| and |FRAME:CPD-15777| (see |FRAME:PWY-7357|) |CITS:[18028398]|.  
/
/It is known that yeast can take up both |FRAME:HMP| and |FRAME:THZ| from its environment |CITS:[4591128] [3027234] [2407290]| indicating that the trifunctional HMP/HMP-P kinase and thiaminase II can handle bot endogenous and exogenous degradation products of |FRAME:THIAMINE|.  Thiaminase II had been demonstrated to significantly increase activity after the addition of |FRAME:ATP|. This finding and the observation that  |FRAME:HMP|, the direct product of the thiaminase II catalysis, is a strong inhibitor of that reaction implies the immediate phosphorylation by the HMP/HMP-P kinase activities of the same enzyme and strongly indicates that the physiological role of THI20 lies in the salvage pathway(s) of |FRAME:THIAMINE|  |CITS:[18028398]|.

CITATIONS - Dey97:EV-EXP:3326556937:christ
COMMENT - NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are formed in the glycolytic and TCA cycles. Each of these energy-rich molecules has a pair of electrons with high transfer potential. The free energy liberated during transfer of those electrons can be used for synthesizing ATP. This electron transfer is performed by a series of four large electron carriers complexes also known as complex I-IV (electron transport chain or respiratory chain), present in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These complexes facilitate the passage of electrons from lower to higher redox potentials. Of those complexes, complex I and II are involved in the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>. The flow of electrons resulting from this oxidation causes protons to be pumped from the matrix side to the intermembrane space. This flow generates a proton-motive force composed of a pH gradient and a membrane potential. Those protons flow back into the matrix through various routes. Particularly, protons flow back through the ATP-synthesizing complex embedded in the mitochondrial membrane leading to the synthesis of ATP. Aerobic respiration combines the transport of electrons resulting from the oxidation of NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, paralleled with the creation of a proton gradient and accompanying membrane potential, leading to the synthesis of ATP |CITS: [DEY97]|.

COMMENT - Flavonoids are secondary metabolites formed from phenylpropanoid and fatty acid derivatives and have important functions, acting as UV-B protectors |CITS:[11724379]|, 
/attractors of pollinators and seed dispersers, insect feeding attractors, anti-feedants, signal molecules in legume-rhizobium bacteria interactions |CITS:[3738520]|, and 
/fungicides. Flavonoids have also received a lot of attention due to their effect of human health. In some plant species, flavonoids are required for fertility, but this is not the 
/case in <i>Arabidopsis</i> |CITS:[8672888]|. 
/
/Biosynthesis is thought to occur in the cytoplasm through enzymes that are associated with the endoplasmatic reticulum membranes |CITS:[3321063]| 
/where the enzymes form a large, macromolecular complex |CITS:[10536025]|. 
/
/The structure of the major flavonoids in <i>Arabidopsis</i> have recently been described |CITS:[10514319]|. Under greenhouse conditions, only kaempferol glycosides accumulate 
/in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. With higher UV exposure, quercetin metabolites can be detected as well |CITS:[10514319]|. Most flavonoids accumulate in the vacuole, the cuticular wax and 
/in the cell wall |CITS:[10975502]|.
/
/Flavonoids constitute a relatively diverse family of aromatic molecules that are derived from Phenylalanine and malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA; via the fatty acidic pathway). |CITS: [11402179]|
/There are six major subgroups found in most higher plants: the chalcones, flavones, flavonols, flavandiols, anthocyanins, and condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins); a seventh 
/group, the aurones, are not ubiquitos. 
/
/Isoflavonoids are found mostly in legumes but also in a small number of non-legume plants and another specialized form of flavonoids, the phlobaphenes 
/(monomers: 3-deoxyanthocyanins), have been detected in only a few species so far. Stilbenes, closely related to flavonoids, are synthesized by yet another group 
/of unrelated species.

COMMENT - In addition to be a building block for protein synthesis, glutamine, along with glutamate, asparagine, 
/and aspartate are used to transport nitrogen through out the plant, and they represent 70% total free 
/amino acids in Arabidopsis. Nitrogen is first assimilated from the soil into glutamine and glutamate via 
/glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, and later into aspartate and asparagine via aspartate 
/aminotransferase and asparagine synthetase. 
/
/Plants have two types of glutamine synthetase isoenzymes: one located in the cytosol (GS1) and the 
/other in the chloroplast (GS2). The Arabidopsis GS1 is encoded by a small family of five genes, 
/whereas GS2 is encoded by a single gene. GS1 is the major form of glutamine synthetase detected in 
/the root. In leaves, both GS1 and GS2 are abundant. 
/
/GS1 is induced by sucrose. GS2 is induced by light (indeed phytochrome) and sucrose. The 
/sucrose-inductions of GS1 and GS2 are at both mRNA and enzyme activity levels. 
/In contrast, amino acids (aspartate, asparagine, glutamate and glutamine) were shown to have an 
/antagonistic effect on the sucrose-induction of GS1 and GS2. Thus, the metabolic regulation of GS1 
/and GS2 in plant is controlled by the relative ratio of carbon versus nitrogen|CITS: [10482686]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Plant growth and development requires macro and micronutrients, some of which are available only from external sources like the soil in which they grow. Phosphorous is one such essential macronutrient, it is usually absorbed and utilized by the plants in the form of |FRAME: Pi phosphate| (also known as inorganic phosphate, or Pi) |CITS: [18713395]|. Many soils are deficient in |FRAME: Pi phosphate|, leading to |FRAME: Pi phosphate| starvation for plants growing in them. Plants develop several strategies to overcome |FRAME: Pi phosphate| limitation, including morphological, biochemical and physiological responses to enhance the acquisition of this vital macronutrient. These combined responses enhance the chances of plants to survive the prospects of |FRAME: Pi phosphate| starvation. Due to continous leaching, ancient soils are known to become limited in the availability of |FRAME: Pi phosphate|. 
/
/Once absorbed, the |FRAME: Pi phosphate| is utilized inside the cells at optimum cellular concentration for the various developmental and biochemical processes. Phosphate acquisition is a complicated process and has various modified routes. The |FRAME: Pi phosphate| homeostasis is maintained by acquisition, limited consumption and effective recycling, when the supply and demand is not equitable. The molecular basis for these strategies is being studied in a number of species |CITS: [19168668]|. The Gulf Ryegrass is an ideal model plant as it hyperaccumulates |FRAME: Pi phosphate| utilizing multiple acquisition and mobilization systems under varying |FRAME: Pi phosphate| regimes |CITS: [1882180]|. In some plants the chief enzymes that partcipate in the transport and recycling of |FRAME: Pi phosphate| are developmentally regulated |CITS: [12021284]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The  Purple Acid Phosphatases (PAP's) are said to play a role in |FRAME: Pi phosphate| salvaging when cells are depleted or starved of |FRAME: Pi phosphate| and under oxidative stress. Thus PAP's are crucial for the cellular metabolism and energy transduction processes. 
/PAP's have also been isolated from mammalian and fungal sources, although the physiological function of these enzymes has yet to be established |CITS: [10510276]|. Genes encoding such enzymes are also present in some bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but their role is not clear. It has been suggested that they prevent damage caused by generated by invaded host cells (mycobacteria) or by the light-harvesting complex (cyanobacteria) |CITS: [11024303]|. However, the enzyme of |FRAME: TAX-216591 <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> J2315| is induced by lack of phosphate and excreted from the cell, suggesting it may be involved in phosphate acquisition |CITS: [19376213]|.
/
/The PAP enzymes may exist in two forms: the inactive purple form, where the redox-active iron is in the ferric state, and the active pink form, where the iron is reduced to the ferrous state.The PAP's are expressed in a tissue specific manner and often exist as isozymes |CITS: [16244908][15375722 ]|. The isozymes exhibit variation in molecular structure, substrate specficity and localization.
/
/Some PAP's, such as |FRAME: MONOMER-15162 alkaline peroxidase / purple acid phosphatase| from |FRAME: TAX-4081 <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>|, are multifunctional enzymes that have both a purple acid phosphatase and an alkaline peroxidase function. These enzymes are hypothesized to function in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) |CITS: [12473124]|. The phosphatase and oxygen radical-generating activities of PAP's are functionally independent, similar to those of mammalian PAP |CITS: [11890682]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>About lipoate</b>
/
/|FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID| is a sulfur-containing cofactor found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. It is utilized by several enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, the |FRAME: PWY-5084| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, the |FRAME: PWY-5046| |CITS: [2188967]|, and the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY| |CITS: [1655709][8444795]|.
/
/Each of these enzyme complexes is composed of multiple copies of three enzymes: a substrate-specific
/decarboxylase-dehydrogenase (<i>E<sub>1</sub></i>), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (<i>E<sub>2</sub></i>)
/specific for each type of complex, and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (<i>E<sub>3</sub></i>), a flavoprotein
/that is a common component of these multienzyme complexes.
/<i>E<sub>1</sub></i> catalyzes both the decarboxylation of the &alpha;-keto acid and the subsequent reductive
/acylation of the lipoyl moiety, which is covalently bound to <i>E<sub>2</sub></i>. <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> catalyzes
/the acyl transfer step, and <i>E<sub>3</sub></i> catalyzes the reoxidation of the dihydrolipoyl moiety with NAD
/as the ultimate electron acceptor |CITS: [2188967]|.
/The lipoate cofactor is bound to the <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> by an amide linkage between its carboxylate moiety
/and a specific lysine residue in the enzyme |CITS: [8444795]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway the enzyme |FRAME: EG11796-MONOMER| (LplA, LplB or LplJ, depending on strain) attaches pre-existing lipoate that has been imported from outside the cell to an <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> enzyme, thus catalyzing a salvage pathway |CITS: [8002607]|. 
/The pathway has been shown to occur in archaea |CITS: [19520844]|, bacteria |CITS: [8206909][8002607]| and animals |CITS: [10103005][11382754]|.
/
/It is generally believed that mammals primarily rely on salvaged |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID|. Even though the genes encoding LipA and LipB have been identified in mammalian genomes, and it has been shown that mammalian cells are capable of synthesizing |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID| in mitochondria |CITS: [11389890]|, their significance is not fully understood.
/The ligation of salvaged |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| in mammals is performed by a single enzyme, LplA (lipoate protein ligase A), which catalyzes both the activation of |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| to a |FRAME: LIPOYL-AMP| intermediate, and the ligation of the later to the <i>E<sub>2</sub></i> subunits, as described here |CITS: [10103005][11382754]|. A similar enzyme has been characterized in bacteria |CITS: [8206909][8002607]|.
/
/In most Archaea the enzyme that catalyzes these reactions is a heterodimer, composed of proteins encoded by |FRAME: G-12044| and |FRAME: G-12043| genes |CITS: [19520844]|. LplB is required for |FRAME: LIPOYL-AMP| formation but is not required for transfer of the lipoyl moiety of lipoyl-adenylate to acceptor proteins |CITS: [19520844]|.

COMMENT - Several types of cytokinins conjugation exist which render cytokinins inactive. When plants are subjected to high levels of cytokinin application, high levels of <i>N</i>-glucosides are detected. In contrast to the <i>O</i>-glucosides, the 7-<i>N</i>- and 9-<i>N</i>-glucosides are resistant to glucosidases, and this feature, together with their accimilation in the plant, has led to the suggestion that N-glucosylation is involved in detoxification |CITS: [15342621]|.

CITATIONS - PMNRXN2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12379 "Eumelanin"| is a common type of |FRAME: MELANIN| pigment, which is found in hair and skin. 
/There are two types of eumelanin, black and brown, which differ by their pattern of polymer bonds.
/A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes grey hair, while a small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments causes yellow (blond) color hair.
/
/Spectroscopic studies of the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-12379| showed that it takes place in three chromophoric phases. The first phase corresponds to the formation of the red pigment |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| (&lambda;max 475 nm) (see |FRAME: PWY-6481|). The second phase corresponds to a purple intermediate, which was designated |FRAME: CPD-12378|, with a broad absorption maximum at 540 nm, and the third phase is characterized by a general absorption due to |FRAME: CPD-12379| |CITS: [Napolitano85]|.
/
/The oxidation of |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| to |FRAME: CPD-12378| occurs spontaneously <i>in vitro</i> but has been shown to be under enzymatic control <i>in vivo</i>. |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| is converted into two compounds - a spontaneous decarboxylation to |FRAME: DIHYDROXYINDOLE|, and an enzymatic tautomerization to |FRAME: 56-DIHYDROXYINDOLE-2-CARBOXYLATE| |CITS: [4031539]|. Both of these products are then oxidized to quinones, which are polymerized to form |FRAME: CPD-12378| and eventually |FRAME: CPD-12379|.
/
/In vertebrates, the pathway involves the activities of three related proteins, all members of the tyrosinase gene family: tyrosinase (|FRAME: HS01248|), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (|FRAME: G-11989|) and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (|FRAME: G-11991|).
/
/The enzymatic activities of |FRAME: HS01248-MONOMER| and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (|FRAME: CPLX-8053|) are well established. |FRAME: HS01248-MONOMER "Tyrosinase"| is the initial, rate-limiting enzyme of melanogenesis, catalyzing the first two steps from |FRAME: TYR| via |FRAME: L-DIHYDROXY-PHENYLALANINE| to |FRAME: DOPAQUINONE|, which goes through a series of spontaneous reactions yielding |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| (see |FRAME: PWY-6481|). Subsequently, the |FRAME: G-11991|-encoded |FRAME: CPLX-8053| converts |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| into |FRAME: 56-DIHYDROXYINDOLE-2-CARBOXYLATE| (DHICA).
/
/The role of the third family member, |FRAME: G-11989|, is less clear. Despite its structural similarity to Tyr and Dct, the enzymatic function of Tyrp1 is controversial and might be species-specific |CITS: [11775055]|. A |FRAME: MONOMER-15620| (DHICA oxidase) activity has been demonstrated for the murine |FRAME: G-11989| protein |CITS: [8027058][7813420][7855068]|, but in humans |FRAME: HS01248| and not TYRP1 performs this function |CITS: [9758418][11171088]|. As Tyr and Tyrp1 are part of the melanogenic complex and are known to form heterodimers, it is possible that the main function of human Tyrp1 is to stabilize tyrosinase |CITS: [7787879][9822646][18042623]|.
/
/The two products of |FRAME: L-DOPACHROME| oxidation, |FRAME: CPD-12373| and |FRAME: CPD-12374|, polymerize to form a mixture of different dimers and trimers, known under the name |FRAME: CPD-12378|. The polymerization can be induced by the presence of certain metal ions such as |FRAME: NI+2| or |FRAME: ZN+2| |CITS: [Napolitano85]|, but could also be catalyzed enzymatically by |FRAME: HS01248-MONOMER| or by peroxidases. Different routes were shown to result in the formation of different compounds.  For example, studies using |FRAME: DIHYDROXYINDOLE| as substrate found that the predominant product was the 2-2'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12408| when metal ions were added, but the 2-4'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12409| when tyrosinase was added |CITS: [Napolitano85]|. When peroxidase was added to the reaction, the 2-4'-linked dimer was still formed, but a third product, the 2-7'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12414| was also present |CITS: [Prota91]|. Similarly, when |FRAME: CPD-12374| was used as substrate, the predominant product was the 4-4'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12411| when metal ions were added, but the 4-7'-linked dimer |FRAME: CPD-12412| when tyrosinase was added |CITS: [Prota91]|.
/
/Defects in TYR result in various forms of albinism. Mutations in TYRP1 in mice result in brown fur, but mutations in the human gene result in a form of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA3).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes. 
/In plants, polyamines have been involved in senescence and morphogenesis |CITS:[11537482]|.  Their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> are however not yet fully understood. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is formed from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (this pathway or, putatively, via |FRAME:PWY-40|).  [<b>Note:</b>  putrescine can also be formed directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; EC 4.1.1.7).  However, it has been shown in the literature that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> most likely lacks enzymes catalyzing reaction EC 4.1.1.17 |CITS:[11576438]| (but is present in other plant species).] 
/There are two flavors of the ADC pathway.  In both cases |FRAME:ARG| is first converted to |FRAME:AGMATHINE| by a biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase. However, in enterobacteria and mycobacteria |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is converted directly to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| by the enzyme |FRAME:AGMATIN-CPLX| (this pathway), while in higher plants, <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., <i>Aeromonas</i> spp., and lactic bacteria, |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is first hydrolyzed by agmatine deiminase into |FRAME:CPD-597| and |FRAME:AMMONIA|, and |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is formed by removal of the ureido group from |FRAME:CPD-597| by the enzyme <i>N</i>-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (this pathway). 
/
/|FRAME:SPERMIDINE| and |FRAME:SPERMINE| are formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, catalyzed by aminopropyltransferases termed spermidine and spermine synthase, respectively.  The propylamine group is transferred from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.  The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.
/
/Although, in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, several enzyme have been predicted to have agmanitase activity, allowing the direct conversion of |FRAME:AGMATHINE| into |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, their activity remains to be confirmed.

COMMENT - <b>General Information :</b> Terpenes comprise a very large class of secondary metabolites that serves a variety of different functions in basic and specialized metabolism. The majority of these compounds are likely to operate as direct defense agents because they often exhibit toxic and deterrent effects against plant pathogens and herbivores. However, since all monoterpenes, many sesquiterpenes and a few diterpenes have high vapor pressure at ambient temperature and volatize easily, these compounds could also act at a distance from the plant, seving as attractants or deterrents for pollinators and herbivores, or as signals released after damage by herbivores to attract their predators and parasitoids. In fact, volatile monterpenes and sesquiterpenes have frequently been shown to be emitted from flowers and other aerial parts of the plant, and their release is often developmentally regulated or induced by damage |CITS: [12724546],[15310830],[14756770]|. Curiously,volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes have also been reported to be synthesized and accumulated in roots and rhizomes of various plant species |CITS: [12214699]|. As a consequence of their antimicrobial and antiherbivore activity, these substances may serve as direct defenses of below-ground tissue when they accumulate. <b>Structural Information :</b> Monoterpenes contain a 10-carbon backbone and are all synthesized from the common precursor geranyl diphosphate by the action of various monoterpene synthases. One characteristic feature of most terpene synthases (TPSs; monoterpenes, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes) is the formation of multiple products from a single substrate |CITS: [9442047]|. Comparative sequence analyses have shown that, within the same plant genome, TPSs making different products may be more similar to each other than TPSs making the same product in different species.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/UDP-xylose (UDP-Xyl) is a nucleotide sugar involved in the synthesis of diverse plant cell wall hemicellulose (xyloglucan, xylan) and minor plant metabolites.  Moreover, UDP-Xyl is required for the synthesis of glycoproteins, animal proteoglycans and fungal polysaccharides (for review see |CITS:[12481102]|). 
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>
/
/In plants, the biosynthesis of UDP-Xyl occurs both in the cytosol and in membrane-bound compartments.  The major biosynthesis route occurs through the conversion of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc).  This conversion involves two enzymatic steps: the oxidation of UDP-Glc to UDP-glucuronate (UDP-GlcA) by a UDP-Glc dehydrogenase and the subsequent decarboxylation to UDP-Xyl by a UDP-GlcA decarboxylase.  Regulation of these enzymes is important in understanding the partitioning of carbon into hemicellulose away from starch, sucrose and cellulose, which are irreversible processes.  Biochemical evidence suggests that the timing of expression of UDP-Glc dehydrogenase and to some extent that of UDP-GlcA decarboxylase may control the flux of carbon into hemicellulose in vascular differentiating tissues.
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>
/
/In plants, two different types of UDP-Glc dehydrogenases have been identified so far: the first type, exemplified by the UDP-Glc dehydrogenase isolated from soybean nodules |CITS:[8938413]|, has a unique catalytic activity towards UDP-Glc (EC 1.1.1.22); the second type exemplified by the mammalian-like tobacco dehydrogenase |CITS:[15821883]| has dual dehydrogenase activities towards UDP-Glc (EC 1.1.1.22) and ethanol (EC 1.1.1.1).  Similarly, biochemical analysis of UDP-glucuronate decarboxylases suggests that this enzyme may come in different forms |CITS:[15821883]|.

COMMENT - All three branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, are essential amino acids, which human and animals must obtain from their diet. The biosynthesis pathways in plants are largely inferred from microbial pathways. Valine and leucine are both derived from pyruvate. Their biosynthesis shares the same initial steps. On the other hand, isoleucine is derived from threonine. However, the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway is almost parallel to valine biosynthesis, except for its first step which involves a threonine deaminase. These two pathways share four common enzymes, each enzyme has dual substrate specificity.
/
/Many steps in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathways are commercially significant targets for herbicides. They include threonine deaminase, acetolactate synthase, and ketol-acid reductoisomerase. 
/
/This pathway occurs in plastids.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyzes the degradation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The enzyme was reported in human, animal and some microbes. Deficiency of PAH in human is related to the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria. It is only very recent, through a phylogenetic and biochemical study, PAH was shown to present in nonflowering plants |CITS: [20959559]|. Still, there is no evidence for its presence in flowering plants |CITS: [20959559], [18245455]|. The cofactor for human PAH is tetrahydrobiopterin |CITS: [10727395]| which however does not exist in plants. In vitro assay of recombinant PAH from chlamydomonas or moss showed highest enzyme activity with 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Thus 10-formyltetrahydrofolate is very likely to be the in vivo cofactor in plants |CITS: [20959559]|. PAH reaction converts the cofactor 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate-4a-carbinolamine which needs to be recycled back to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Similar to the human pathway (see |FRAME: PHENYLALANINE-DEG1-PWY|), the cofactor regeneration in plants needs pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) and q-dihydropterin reductase (qDHPR). Plant PCD has been identified [18245455], but qDHPR remains to be unknown in plants. The qDHPR reaction seems unlikely to be mediated by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) because PAH and PCD are both plastidial yet DHFR is in mitochondria |CITS: [21275646]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: SUCROSE Sucrose| is an important disaccharide in plants and plays a major role in moving carbon through the plant via the phloem from "source" tissues such as photosynthesizing leaves to "sink" tissues such as roots |CITS:[23393426]|. In the light, triose phosphate, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation, is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm where it is transformed to hexose phosphate by enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway. These hexoses are then used in |FRAME: SUCSYN-PWY sucrose biosynthesis|. However, as shown in this pathway, |FRAME: SUCROSE| is also produced from the |FRAME: PWY-6724 degradation of starch reserves| using |FRAME: MALTOSE| and |FRAME: GLC| exported from the chloroplast |CITS:[23393426]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/During |FRAME: PWY-6724 starch breakdown| in the chloroplast, |FRAME: MALTOSE| and |FRAME: GLC| are liberated through a cascade of different enzymatic reactions. |FRAME: MALTOSE| can then be transported to the cytosol via |FRAME: AT5G17520-MONOMER MEX1| while |FRAME: GLC| can be transported by |FRAME:AT5G16150-MONOMER pGlcT|. 
/
/In the cytosol, the |FRAME: MALTOSE| is used by |FRAME: AT2G40840-MONOMER DPE2| to attach glucosyl units to the poorly defined class of compounds referred to as |FRAME: Soluble-Heteroglycans Soluble HeteroGlycans| (SHG). This liberates one glucose directly, but |FRAME: AT3G46970-MONOMER PHS2| can also liberate the deposited glucose from SHG in the form of |FRAME: GLC-1-P| |CITS: [16980562][23393426][16640603]|. This can then be used in a series of reactions shared with the other |FRAME: SUCSYN-PWY sucrose biosynthesis pathway|. Namely, |FRAME: GLC-1-P| can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-12575| and then |FRAME:SUCROSE| via a |FRAME: SUCROSE-6P| intermediate. 
/
/Meanwhile, the |FRAME: GLC| derived from |FRAME: PWY-6724 starch degradation| can be converted to |FRAME: GLC-6-P| vias the activity of cytosolic hexokinase. This product can also then be funneled toward the production of |FRAME: GLC-1-P| via the activity of a |FRAME: AT5G51820-MONOMER phosphoglucomutase|. 
/
/There is another enzyme that can form sucrose - |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.13|. However, the name of this latter enzyme is misleading, since it has been shown that under most physiological conditions it catalyzes a sucrose cleavage reaction, and is thus involved in sucrose degradation |CITS: [plantbiochemistry97]| (see |FRAME: PWY-3801|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Pantothenate (vitamin B<sub>5</sub>) is the universal precursor for the 
/synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of coenzyme A and acyl carrier protein. Only plants and 
/microorganisms can synthesize pantothenate <i>de novo</i>. In contrast to the bacterial biosynthesis 
/of pantothenate (|FRAME:PANTO-PWY|), plant pathways for pantothenate formation are incomplete. 
/
/Coenzyme A (CoA), derived from pantothenate is a cofactor of ubiquitous occurrence in plants, bacteria 
/and animals needed in a large number of enzymatic reactions central to intermediary metabolism, including 
/the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Feeding studies in <i>Pisum sativum</i> leaf discs support the existence of a 
/similar biosynthesis pathway of pantothenate via pantoate: when fed with [<sup>14</sup>C]valine, the radiolabel 
/was incorporated into &alpha;-oxoisovalerate, oxopantoate and pantoate |CITS:[jones94]|. The last enzyme 
/of the pathway: pantothenate synthetase catalyzes the formation of pantothenate from pantoate and &beta;-alanine. 
/The origin of plant &beta;-alanine is uncertain but appears to be different from that of bacteria which synthesize 
/it from L-aspartate. Instead plants seem to produce &beta;-alanine from a variety of other sources, like polyamines, 
/uracil and propionate (for one example, see |FRAME:PWY-3941|) |CITS: [16042590][17932772]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of CoA is carried out from pantothenate in five enzymatic steps. All of the enzymes involved 
/have been recently identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the metabolic sequence confirmed <i>in vitro</i> 
/by combining the recombinant enzymes |CITS: [12860978]|. 
/
/Pantothenate kinase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step, phosphorylates 4'-phosphopantothenate to 
/4'-phosphopantothenate followed by the addition of cysteine resulting in the formation of (R)-4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine 
/(PPC). PPC is decarboxylated in the next reaction to 4'-phosphopantetheine and then in two successive reactions 
/converted to CoA by the enzymatic action of 4'-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase 
/|CITS: [12860978]| |CITS: [12614618]|. The reactions in the biosynthetic route towards CoA parallel the reaction 
/sequence obtained in bacteria but differ regarding the functionality of the involved enzymes. In plants every step 
/is catalyzed by single monofunctional enzymes, whereas in bacteria and mammals bifunctional enzymes are
/employed |CITS: [16415216]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Vitamin B6 (VB6) exists in various forms such as the vitamers pyridoxal,

/<b>About the pathway</b>: The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate salvage pathway comprises two main reactions

/catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the 5-hydroxyl group of the B6 vitamers pyridoxal, 
/pyridoxine and pyridoxamine, hence creating either the final pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) or the phosphorylated 
/intermediates of pyridoxine and pyridoxamine. The enzyme has been isolated from and partially characterized 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> being shown a close similarity to the structure of the mammalian counterpart

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12847| is a blue-pigmented phenazine derivative and is the principal phenazine compound produced by the opportunistic human pathogen |FRAME: TAX-287|.  It is believed to provide this organism with a competitive growth advantage and to be a virulence factor in diseases such as cystic fibrosis.  Its toxicity is due to its ability to participate in redox reactions that generate reactive |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| species, depleting cellular antioxidants.  It is biosynthesized from the common phenazine precursor |FRAME: CPD-9522| as indicated by the pathway link (in |CITS: [17253782]| and in |CITS: [18416536]|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The conversion of |FRAME: CPD-9522| to |FRAME: CPD-12847| is proposed to occur in a two-step conversion via the reactive, unstable intermediate |FRAME: CPD-12869|, catalyzed by the products of genes <i>phzM</i> and <i>phzS</i>.  Both steps appeared to require the formation of at least a transient complex between the dimeric PhzM and PhzS.  Evidence suggested that the complex contained equimolar amounts of PhzM and PhzS, although a stable complex could not be isolated.  PhzM alone had no methylation activity toward |FRAME: CPD-9522|, but |FRAME: CPD-12847| was produced in the presence of PhzS and |FRAME: NADH|.  Formation of a complex between PhzM and PhzS would presumably prevent release of |FRAME: CPD-12869|.  PhzM is a putative |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent <i>N</i>-methyltransferase and PhzS is a putative flavin-dependent aromatic hydroxylase (in |CITS: [17253782]| and in |CITS: [18416536]|).
/
/PhzS has also been shown to act directly on |FRAME: CPD-9522| to produce |FRAME: PYOCYANINE-RED|, but this compound was not a precursor for |FRAME: CPD-12847| and therefore PhzM must act before PhzS (in |CITS: [17253782]|).  |FRAME: CPD-12869| was shown in earlier work to be an intermediate in biosynthesis of the phenazine |FRAME: CPD-10379| (in |CITS: [18416536]|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6956 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/Thiamin biosynthesis is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| (see for example |FRAME: PWY-6893|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway describes the synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin. Starting with |FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE|, an intermdiate in purine biosynthesis, two enzymatic steps, catalyzed by |FRAME: THIC-MONOMER "ThiC"| and |FRAME: HMP-P-KIN-CPLX "ThiD"|, produce |FRAME: AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP|.
/The first reaction is one of the most complicated rearrangement reactions known. The ThiC enzyme belongs to the radical SAM family, all members of which utilize |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM) to generate an 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical that in turn serves as an oxidant for a wide variety of enzymatic reactions |CITS: [18953358]|. The first stage of catalysis is the reduction of SAM to produce |FRAME: MET| and a 5-deoxyadenosyl radical, which is generated at the active site. The radical reacts directly with the substrate to catalyze a complex rearrangement reaction that includes two iterative hydrogen atom abstractions (which necessitates the regeneration of the radical following the first abstraction). C1' and C3' of the substrate, which are not inorporated into the product, are converted to formate and carbon monoxide, respectively |CITS: [20886485]|.
/
/The second enzyme, ThiD, is a simple kinase. It is a bifunctional enzyme, and can also phosphorylate |FRAME: HMP|, as a part of a thiamin salvage pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6897|) |CITS: [14973012]|.

COMMENT - Lysine biosynthesis in plants was thought to be identical to the prokaryotic DAP (diaminopimelate) pathway that
/uses N-succinylated intermediates |CITS: [15652176]|
/(See |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY| in MetaCyc).
/However the Arabidopsis genome does not contain a  
/tetrahydrodipicolinate succinylase homolog catalyzing reaction EC 2.3.1.117. Further more, the Arabidopsis  
/homologs of N-succinyldiaminopimelate-aminotransferase and N-succinyl-L-diaminopimelate desuccinylase,  
/catalyzing the consequent steps 2.6.1.17 and 3.5.1.18, respectively, are not likely to function in lysine  
/biosynthesis|CITS: [15652176]|. It suggested that plants may synthesize lysine via an enzyme that by pass the three  
/reactions by directly converting tetrahydrodipicolinate to L,L-diaminopimelate. An recent article by Hudson and  
/colleagues |CITS: [16361515]| indeed demonstrated that Arabidopsis has an functional L,L-diaminopimelate  
/aminotransferase that fulfills the catalytic activity. In addition, this enzymatic activity was detected in several other
/plant species including soybean, spinach, and moss (<i>P. patens</i>) |CITS: [16361515]|.
/The Arabidopsis enzyme catalyzes a reversible reaction. Although  
/the forward reaction towards lysine biosynthesis is unfavorable, the enzyme was shown to be involved in  
/lysine biosynthesis under physiological conditions by functional complementation of the E.coli lysine biosynthesis  
/double mutant of dapD and dapE. 
/ 
/The first committed enzyme of lysine biosynthesis, dihydrodipicolinate synthase, is feedback regulated by  
/lysine|CITS: [8000011]|. Its catalyzed reaction is the rate-limiting step for lysine biosynthesis. L,L-diaminopimelate  
/aminotransferase may impose another regulation point of lysine biosynthesis. Using maize cultured embryo cells,  
/it was shown that the overall rate of lysine synthesis is in the same range of the forward reaction catalyzed  
/by L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase |CITS: [16361515]|. 
/ 
/Lysine biosynthesis occurs within chloroplasts. No evidence exists for extra plastidic location of the pathway
/|CITS: [15652176]|.
/
/
/<b>General Background</b> 
/ 
/Several pathways have been recognized in bacteria, most algae, fungi and higher plants for the biosynthesis of lysine. 
/They are divided into two groups - the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways, and the |FRAME:CPD-468| (AAA) pathways. 
/ 
/In the pathways that belong to the DAP group, lysine is produced from aspartate (along with methionine, threonine 
/and isoleucine). All of these pathways share the upper segments, which include the four steps required for 
/conversion of  L-aspartate to |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE|. 
/They also share the last step, which is the conversion of the intermediate |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| 
/(D,L-DAP, or <i>meso</i>-DAP) to lysine. However, these pathways differ in the routes leading from |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| 
/to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|. The four variations include: 
/ 
/(I) the succinylase variant (see |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|), which involves succinylated intermediates. 
/In this route |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is coverted to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in four enzymatic steps. 
/ 
/(II) the acetylase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-2941|), which involves acetylated intermediates. This route also involves
/four enzymatic steps for the conversion of |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE|
/to |FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|. 
/ 
/(III) the dehydrogenase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-2942|), in which |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to 
/|FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in a single enzymatic step.  
/ 
/(IV) the diaminopimelate-aminotransferase variant (see |FRAME: PWY-5097|), in which |FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to 
/|FRAME:MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in two steps.
/
/(VI) the L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase variant (this pathway), in which
/|FRAME: DELTA1-PIPERIDEINE-2-6-DICARBOXYLATE| is converted to |FRAME: LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| in a single step. 
/ 
/In addition to lysine, the pathways in this group also produce <i>meso</i>-DAP, which is an important metabolite
/on its own (for example, as a constituent of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan). 
/ 
/The two other pathways belong to the |FRAME: CPD-468| group. They are found in organisms that have no requirement for
/<i>meso</i>-DAP, as it is not a component of their cell walls.  
/These pathways also share the first segments, leading to the synthesis of the intermediate &alpha;-aminoadipate. 
/However, in yeast and fungi, as well as  <i>Euglena</i>, the pathway continues with the key enzyme 
/&alpha;-aminoadipate reductase, leading to the intermediate saccharopine (see 
/|FRAME: LYSINE-AMINOAD-PWY|), while in prokaryotes the pathway continues in a path similar to 
/bacterial arginine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-3081|). 
/ 
/Most of the bacteria which have been investigated in detail appear to utilize only one of these pathways 
/|CITS: [1906065]|. A few exceptions include <i>Paenibacillus macerans</i>, in which variants (II) and (III) seem to  
/coexist |CITS: [BARTLETT85]|, and <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i>, in which variant (I) and (III) coexist 
/|CITS: [1906065]|. 
/ 
/Lysine is one of the 10 essential amino acids that mammals are unable to synthesize, and must therefore acquire 
/in their diets.   
/
/<B>Note</B>: Enzymes supported by experimental evidence are shown in bold on pathway diagrams. We have also incorporated genes that were computationally annotated as enzymes, as well as their assignments to pathways from species-specific pathway databases such as aracyc (Arabidopsis thaliana col) or ricecyc (Oryza sativa Japonica Group).

COMMENT - The pathway depicted here is believed of less significance <i>in planta</i>. The formation of hydroxycinnamic 
/acids, at least ferulic acid and sinapic acid has been demonstrated not to occur via the free phenylpropanoid 
/acids (this pathway) but via the metabolic sequence described in the ferulate amd sinapate biosynthesis 
/(|FRAME:PWY-5168|). However, the existence of this pathway cannot entirely ruled out since mutants defective 
/in the key enzyme presumably generating ferulic acid and sinapic acid |CITS: [14729911]| still possess small 
/amounts of corresponding hydroxycinnamic acid esters. 
/
/The free phenylpropanoid acid biosynthesis pathway generates simple hydroxycinnamic acids, containing the characteristic C6C3 phenylpropane 
/skeleton, as found in cinnamic acids (cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid) and their descendants in the lignin 
/biosynthetic route, coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. Moreover, the phenylpropanoid pathway is 
/the origin of more complex secondary compounds such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids and stilbenes, formed by condensation 
/with phenylpropanoids and malonyl coenzyme A |CITS: [Dixon02]|.
/
/More compound classes derived from phenylpropanoids include sinapate esters, condendsed tannins, anthocyanins,
/coumarins, and benzoic acids. Some phenylpropanoids such as lignins, hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids are 
/ubiquitous distributed in higher plants whereas other classes, like the isoflavonoids and stilbenes have a more restricted 
/distribution within the plant kingdom. 
/
/The functions of phenylpropanoid vary as much as their structural composition. Phenylpropanoids serve as pigments,
/phytoalexins, phytoanticipins, UV protectants and signal molecules between plant and microbes, they can polymerize 
/and fulfill functions of cell wall stability, provide structures for evapotranspiration (lignin) and protect plants against loss 
/of water (cutin, suberin) |CITS: [Hahlbrock89]|.
/
/It has been argued for a long time that the enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway are organized in one or more enzyme 
/complexes. Phenylpropanoid metabolism is largly unique to plants, and although quite complex one of the best-studied 
/pathways in plants. There is now evidence for the coordinated expression of genes and enzymes, channeling intermediates
/into a controlled metabolic flux which triggers the subsequent pathways in a concerted manner |CITS: [15725058]|.
/
/Dixon's group  |CITS: [15472080]| could demonstrate the existence of a multi-enzyme complex for the coordinated 
/action of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and cinnamte-4-hydroxylase (C4H) controlling the flux of intermediates in 
/the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The biosynthesis of several important metabolites involves the consumption of |FRAME: MET| through the utilization of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), in a reaction that releases |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA).
/These metabilites include polyamines (see |FRAME: ARGSPECAT-PWY|, |FRAME:BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-1303|), |FRAME: ETHYLENE-CMPD| (see |FRAME: ETHYL-PWY|), and bacterial auto-inducers (see |FRAME: PWY-6157|).
/
/|FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration is tightly regulated through the methionine salvage cycle, where MTA is recycled through a series of reactions back to |FRAME: MET|.
/
/The methionine salvage pathway, also called the Yang cycle, is present with some variations in all types of organisms |CITS: [19946895]| (|FRAME: TAX-562| is a notorious exception). It has been partially characterized from a number of organisms, including bacteria |CITS:[8227039][7852397][8694776][9880484][11371200]|, plants |CITS: [Baur72][Murr75][Kushad83][Miyazaki87]|, yeast |CITS: [3906034]|, protozoal parasites |CITS: [8585735][ 11443076]| and rat |CITS: [7007366][7068632][7852397]|.

/While most of the pathway is conserved among all organisms, several variants exist that differ in the initial steps of the pathway, between |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) and |FRAME: CPD-1063| (MTRP). These variants, describing bacteria and plants, higher eukaryotes, and protozoa, are described by several pathways under |FRAME: Methylthioadenosine-Degradation|.
/This metabolic differences in the early steps of the methionine salvage pathway are being exploited for developing new drugs targeted against pathogenic microorganisms |CITS: [2854458][2153115][1929327]|.
/
/Several variants of the methionine salvage cycle are available in MetaCyc. The pathway shown here operates in bacteria and plants and includes polyamine biosynthesis.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here depicts the formation of MTA by the production of the polyamine |FRAME: SPERMIDINE|, although MTA is also formed during the biosynthesis of other polyamines.
/Unlike in higher eukaryotes, where the recycling of MTA to methionine starts with phosphorolytic cleavage by |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.28| to yield |FRAME: CPD-444|, in most bacteria and plants this conversion is achieved by the action of two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.16| and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.100|, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-560| |CITS: [8694776][10574451]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6754|).
/
/Once |FRAME: CPD-444| is formed, it is recycled back to L-methionine in 6 steps, comprising an isomerase, a dehydratase, an enolase, a phosphatase, an oxygenase, and a transaminase. The last enzyme, a glutamine-dependent transaminase, produces the byproduct |FRAME: 2-KETO-GLUTARAMATE|, which is believed to be toxic. Thus an additional enzyme, an &omega;-amidase that converts the latter to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, is also considered a part of the pathway |CITS: [24837359]|.
/
/<b>A few notes of interest about the enzymes of this pathway</b>
/
/At least in some strains, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, |FRAME: EC-5.3.2.5|, is a one of the few members of the RubisCO protein family |CITS: [17352497]|.
/
/The reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.13.11.54|, can occur non-enzymatically in the presence of air. It is yet unknown whether the non-enzymatic reaction occurs <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [7852397]|.
/If the enzyme that usually catalyzes this reaction binds a Ni<sup>2+</sup> instead of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, it catalyzes a different reaction (|FRAME: EC-1.13.11.53|), forming a shunt of the methionine salvage pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5389|) |CITS:[7852397] [9880484][11371200]|. While the purpose of this shunt is yet unknown, it has been suggested that it may provide a mechanism for regulating |FRAME: MET| levels <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [11371200]|.
/
/In some organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-571|, the reactions catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-5.3.2.5| (MtnW) and |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.87| (MtnX) are catalyzed by a single enzyme, |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.77| (MtnC).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In this pathway multiple units of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) undergo a series of polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain.
/
/The sequential addition of isoprenyl units to |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| is performed by polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzymes such as the |FRAME:TAX-562| enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7426|.
/
/Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by the specific enzyme. Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules, such as quinones. The enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a preference towards a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone molecule is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/In most organisms there is one type of a predominant quinone, with a specific polyprenyl chain length. However, most organisms also have minor amounts of quinones with a different polyprenyl chain length. Quinones that contain a chain of 6 isoprenyl units are not common in bacteria, although they are quite common in yeast. Among the bacteria whose primary quinone contains a 6-isoprenyl chain are members of the Gram-negative genera |FRAME: TAX-210| |CITS: [8674971]|, |FRAME: TAX-1016| and |FRAME: TAX-872|, as well as some members of the Gram-positive genus |FRAME:TAX-1279|. For a review detailing the polyprenyl chain length distribution in different bacteria, see |CITS: [7022156]|.  
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4932| the initial addition of two isoprenyl units to form |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| is catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-710|, encoded by |FRAME: YJL167W|. An additional unit is added by |FRAME: MONOMER-13701| (encoded by |FRAME: G-10461|), resulting in formation of |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP|. The last enzyme in this pathway is |FRAME: CPLX-7572| (encoded by |FRAME: G-10462|), which adds additional isoprenoid units to a maximal length of 6 units. When yeast COQ1 mutants are complemented with homologs from other organisms, ubiquinone biosynthesis is restored, but the tail lenghth of the quinone depends on the source of the enzyme |CITS: [9324242]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: ACETALD "Acetaldehyde"| is one of the products that are released by plants into the atmosphere. This compound is reactive and of immense interest to atmospheric chemists, who are not able to account for large amounts of biogenic |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde| |CITS: [19538397]|. 
/
/This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde| under flooding conditions. Under these conditions |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde| is primarily emmited from the roots. One source of |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde| is |FRAME: ETOH ethanol|, which is produced under anoxic conditions. The |FRAME: ETOH ethanol| is reduced to |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde| by |FRAME: MONOMER-15105 alcohol dehydrogenase| enzymes.
/
/Another source for |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde| is |FRAME: PYRUVATE pyruvate|. The roots use glycosis as the main source of ATP under flooding, resulting in |FRAME: PYRUVATE pyruvate| formation. The |FRAME: PYRUVATE pyruvate| is decarboxylated by the |FRAME: MONOMER-9201 pyruvate decarboxylase| (PDC) to form |FRAME: ACETALD acetaldehyde|. Pyruvic decarboxylase (PDC) is essential for the survival of plants under anaerobic conditions |CITS: [8806407]|. 
/
/Sequence comparison of cis-regulating signals of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (adh) from different species such as |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>|, |FRAME: TAX-3888 <i>Pisum sativum</i>| and |FRAME: TAX-4577 <i>Zea mays</i>| showed that a short stretch of the promoter region may be involved in the anaerobic regulation of plant adh genes |CITS: [3309331]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE "1,2-Diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate"|, often referred to as phosphatidate (PA), is a class of compounds consisting of a |FRAME: GLYCEROL| backbone, a (usually) saturated fatty acid bonded to carbon 1, a (usually) unsaturated fatty acid bonded to carbon 2, and a phosphate group esterified to carbon 3.
/
/PA is an intermediate in structural lipid biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN2-PWY| and |FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY|), and an important second messenger. In plants, PA is rapidly and transiently generated in response to a number of biotic (pathogens) and abiotic (such as cold and salt stress) stimulates (reviewed in |CITS: [16023886]|). Using a so-called differential labeling method, it was shown that there are two pathways, the phospholipase C and diacylglycerol kinase pathway (PLC pathway), and the phospholipase D pathway (PLD pathway), that generate PA as a signaling molecule in response to environmental signals (reviewed in |CITS: [19394438]|). In the PLC pathway, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, derived from phosphatidylinositol, is converted to diacylglycerol which is rapidly phosphorylated to PA. In the PLD pathway, PA is directly formed from structural lipid phosphatidylcholine. The two pathways are differentially activated in response to different stimulates |CITS: [16023886]|. Once formed, PA can be further converted to diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) by PA kinase (reviewed in |CITS: [16469533]|). This is a possible mechanism in PA attenuation. Interestingly, mammals do not seem to have PA kinase activity.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides Lipopolysaccharides| (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; the core oligosaccharide, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria.
/
/Gram-positive bacteria and Archaea do not have a lipopolysaccharide. Instead they possess the S-layer (surface layer) as a component of the cell envelope |CITS: [11742749][1938891]|. The S-layer is composed of a single layer of identical proteins or glycoproteins that form a two-dimensional, monomolecular crystalline array |CITS:[7934867]|. Structurally, S-layer glycoproteins from Gram-positive bacteria resemble the O-antigens of Gram-negative organisms, and often contain similar modified sugar building blocks |CITS: [11741945]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12575| is a widespread compound with housekeeping roles, but it also acts as a precursor for the synthesis of specific sugar residues used by some bacteriail species for incorporation in polysaccharides such as the repeat unit of their O-antigen or S-layer glycoproteins.
/
/The |FRAME: G-17652| gene encodes a dehydrogenase that catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-12575| to |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE|. This is a housekeeping gene in organisms that produce |FRAME: CPD0-1099|, such as |FRAME:TAX-562| and |FRAME:TAX-28901|, since |FRAME: CPD-14488| is a component of |FRAME: CPD0-1099|. However, |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is also used by some Gram-negative bacteria as one of the sugars of their O-antigen |CITS: [14670712]| and by some Gram-positive bacteria for their polysaccharide capsule |CITS: [8463246]|.
/
/|FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| can be converted by an epimerase to |FRAME: UDP-D-GALACTURONATE| |CITS: [13584369]|. |FRAME: CPD-12523| is also found in the O-antigens and capsule polysaccharides of some organisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-1162729|, |FRAME: TAX-45888| and |FRAME: TAX-1313| |CITS: [7534644][14559113][13426189]|.

/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE| (ascorbic acid, vitamin C) is a reducing agent and antioxidant biosynthesized by plants, eukaryotic algae, some bacteria and many, but not all vertebrates.  Its biosynthetic pathways in these organisms are shown here and in the variant pathway links listed on this page.  |FRAME: ASCORBATE| is an essential vitamin in the diet of humans, non-human primates and certain other vertebrates that cannot biosynthesize it.  These species rely on mechanisms for efficient uptake and recycling of this vitamin (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6370|).  A deficiency of vitamin C leads to the disorder scurvy.  |FRAME: ASCORBATE| is used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of vitamin supplements, cosmetics and therapeutic preparations.  It is also used in the food, beverage and animal feed industries. Reviewed in |CITS: [16516325] [17222174]|.
/
/In photosynthesizing plants and eukaryotic algae |FRAME: ASCORBATE| has roles in metabolism, electron transport, the cell cycle and responses to pathogens and abiotic stress.  When coupled with its redox system, the ascorbate/glutathione cycle, |FRAME: ASCORBATE| can effectively regulate cellular |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| levels (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-2261|).  Reviewed in |CITS: [18460785]|.
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE| is the most abundant water-soluble redox compound in photosynthesizing plants and eukaryotic algae.  In plants it is biosynthesized mainly by the L-galactose pathway (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-882|), although other plant pathways have also been proposed (see pathways |FRAME: PWY4FS-11|, |FRAME: PWY4FS-12| and |FRAME: PWY4FS-13|).  In addition, a pathway based on uronic acid intermediates has been proposed in higher plants, but a key enzyme, aldonolactonase, has not been identified (in |CITS: [18782759]|).  However, there is evidence for a unique |FRAME: ASCORBATE| biosynthesis pathway based on uronic acid intermediates in the photosynthetic, unicellular eukaryote |FRAME: ORG-6122|, in which aldonolactonase has been identified (|CITS: [18782759]| and in |CITS: [17090924]|) (this pathway).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/
/An early report provided evidence for a major |FRAME: ASCORBATE| biosynthesis pathway based on uronic acid intermediates in the photosynthetic, unicellular eukaryote |FRAME: ORG-6122|, based on feeding and isotope dilution experiments, and enzyme assays |CITS: [118242]|.  In later work the gene encoding the key enzyme aldonolactonase was cloned, expressed and its product characterized.  The role of this enzyme in the pathway was demonstrated  by silencing the expression of aldonolactonase using RNA interference.  It was concluded that this is the major pathway for |FRAME: ASCORBATE| biosynthesis in |FRAME: ORG-6122|.  However, more work in needed to determine its role in other eukaryotic photosynthetic algae and in higher plants |CITS: [18782759]|.  The pathway is shown here along with enzymes participating in the pathway that have been characterized |CITS: [18782759] [17090924] [SHIGEOKA79]|.
/
/In addition, evidence for a minor, alternative pathway for |FRAME: ASCORBATE| biosynthesis via |FRAME: GLUCURONATE| -> |FRAME: L-GULONATE| -> |FRAME: L-GULONO-1-4-LACTONE| was also found in |FRAME: ORG-6122| |CITS: [118242]| (not shown).  However, the flux through this pathway is much lower than the pathway shown here (|CITS: [18782759]| and in |CITS: [17090924]|).  It is likely that the pathway shown here is an effective route for maintenance of cellular |FRAME: ASCORBATE| levels in this organism (in |CITS: [18782759]|).  Reviewed in |CITS: [18460785]|.
/
/The pathway shown here begins with |FRAME: CPD-12575| which is likely formed from precursors |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE|, |FRAME: ALPHA-GLC-6-P| |CITS: [18460785]| and  |FRAME: GLC-1-P| (as in reactions EC 2.7.1.1, EC 5.4.2.2 and EC 2.7.7.9) (not shown).  |FRAME: D-Glucose| was shown to be a more efficient precursor for |FRAME: ASCORBATE| biosynthesis than |FRAME: D-Galactose| |CITS: [118242]|.  UDP-D-glucose dehydrogenase activity produces |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| |CITS: [118242]|.  The ubiquitous cellular UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase would catalyze the formation of |FRAME: UDP-D-GALACTURONATE| (in |CITS: [118242]|).  Hypothetically, this compound is converted to |FRAME: CPD-501| by a phosphatase, pyrophosphatase (such as in EC 3.6.1.45), or uridylyltransferase (such as in EC 2.7.7.64), followed by dephosphorylation to |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| (in |CITS: [18460785]|).  The remainder of the pathway from |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| to |FRAME: ASCORBATE| is based on experimental characterization of the enzymes involved.  Reduction of |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| produces |FRAME: CPD0-1083|, which is lactonized by aldonolactonase to |FRAME: CPD-330|.  This lactone is then dehydrogenated to |FRAME: ASCORBATE| (in |CITS: [18782759]|).  The dehydrogenase from |FRAME: ORG-6122| differs from the analogous plant (EC 1.3.2.3) and animal (EC 1.1.3.8) enzymes in substrate specificity and electron acceptor |CITS: [SHIGEOKA79]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Vitamin C (|FRAME: ASCORBATE|), a reducing agent and antioxidant, is a cofactor in reactions catalyzed by
/copper-dependent monooxygenases and iron-dependent dioxygenases. It is synthesized, in vertebrates having
/this capacity, from |FRAME: GLUCURONATE|. This compound is formed through direct hydrolysis
/of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| by enzyme(s) bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.  They share many
/properties with, and are most likely identical to, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases |CITS:[17222174]|.
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE| can be biosynthesized by plants (see |FRAME: PWY-882|), some bacteria
/(see |FRAME: PWY-5521|) and many vertebrates.  It is used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production
/of vitamin supplements, cosmetics and therapeutic preparations.  It is also used in the food, beverage and
/animal feed industries.  
/
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE| is an essential vitamin in the diet of humans, non-human primates and certain other
/vertebrates that cannot biosynthesize it (some fish and birds, bats and guinea pigs).  These species rely on
/mechanisms for efficient uptake and recycling of this vitamin (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6370|).  It is taken up in the intestine, transported in plasma and delivered to tissues.  Its recycling in erythrocytes has been described (reviewed in |CITS: [9405334]|).  It has roles in collagen biosynthesis, as an antioxidant, as a cofactor in reactions catalyzed by some metal-dependent mono- and dioxygenases, and may be involved in cell signaling reactions and transcription factor activation.  A deficiency of vitamin C leads to the disorder scurvy (reviewed in |CITS: [16516325] [17222174]|).  Yeasts are known to biosynthesize D-erythroascorbate, a 5-carbon analog of ascorbate.  It functions as an antioxidant, but it lacks antiscorbutic activity (prevention of scurvy) (reviewed in |CITS: [16516325]|).  
/
/The mammalian liver pathway for |FRAME: ASCORBATE| biosynthesis is shown here.  |FRAME: GLUCURONATE| is
/formed from hydrolysis of |FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| by a membrane-bound enzyme(s) of the endoplasmic
/reticulum, probably UDP-glucuronidase(s) (reviewed in |CITS: [17222174]|.  The ultimate precursor of
/|FRAME: UDP-GLUCURONATE| is D-glucose (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-4821|).  |FRAME: GLUCURONATE| is 
/reduced to |FRAME: L-GULONATE| by a NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent aldehyde reductase.  A broad specificity
/lactonase then forms |FRAME: L-GULONO-1-4-LACTONE|.  The |FRAME: L-GULONO-1-4-LACTONE| is oxidized
/to |FRAME: ASCORBATE| by L-gulonolactone oxidase via an intermediate lactone which spontaneously isomerizes
/to |FRAME: ASCORBATE|.  The production of hydrogen peroxide by this endoplasmic reticulum enzyme is unusual and transfer
/of electrons to another acceptor might occur in intact cells, as has been shown for plant homologues of this
/enzyme.  L-Gulonolactone oxidase is deficient in humans and other animals unable to biosynthesize
/|FRAME: ASCORBATE| due to mutations in the gene encoding it |CITS: [8175804]|.  Reviewed in
/|CITS: [17222174] [9405334]|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The carotenoid pigments are synthesized in the plastids of plants where it is derived from the pathways
/of isoprenoid biosynthesis (for review, see |CITS:[15012246]|).  More specifically, the first committed
/step of carotenoid biosynthesis is that of the formation of phytoene from geranylgeranyl diphosphate,
/obtained from the |FRAME:PWY-5121|.  This conversion is in fact a two-step reaction catalyzed by the
/enzyme phytoene synthase.
/Phytoene then undergoes a series of four desaturation reactions leading to the formation of
/|FRAME:CPD1F-114| <i>via</i> |FRAME:CPD-7408|, |FRAME:CPD1F-98|, |FRAME:NEUROSPORENE|.
/Although the desaturation steps use all-<i>trans</i> compounds in bacteria, plants accumulate small
/amounts of <i>cis</i>-carotenes indicative of additional <i>cis</i>-to-<i>trans</i> isomerization steps
/(see note below).
/An important branch-point in the biosynthesis of carotenoids lies in the cyclization of the linear, pink
/|FRAME:CPD1F-114| into carotenes with all-&beta;-, all-&epsilon;- or mixed &beta; and &epsilon; rings.
/Carotenoids with two &epsilon; rings are, however, rarely observed in plants and algae, and, when
/detected, are usually found in trace amounts |CITS:[GOODWIN80]|; lettuce is a rare example of plants
/known to accumulate substantial amounts of bicyclic &epsilon; ring carotenoids (see
/|FRAME:PWY-5175|).  The cyclization reaction are catalyzed by lycopene &beta;- or &epsilon;-cyclases.
/These cyclases all share an amino acid sequence signature that is conserved in those enzymes and
/binds dinucleotides such as FAD and NADP |CITS:[8837512]|, but otherwise share little resemblance.
/The formation of &alpha;-carotene from lycopene is likely to proceed by the addition of a &beta;-ring to
/|FRAME:CPD1F-115|.  The alternative route (addition of an &epsilon;-ring to |FRAME:CPD1F-126|)
/appears unlikely as the &epsilon;-cyclase does not seem to be able to add a second &epsilon; ring to
/the monocyclic &delta;-carotene |CITS:[8837512]|.
/
/Finally, the carotenes are oxygenated in various ways (hydroxylation, epoxydation, de-epoxidation) to
/form xanthophylls which comprise most of the carotenoid pigments in the thylakoid membrane of plants.
/ Hydroxylations play an important role in the oxygenation of carotenes and are catalyzed by hydroxylases
/acting specifically onto &beta; or &epsilon; rings.
/
/It has been postulated that the regulation of &epsilon;-cyclase, possibly through control of gene
/expression, determines xanthophylls composition in leaves and other plant tissues, since its products
/(&delta;-carotene) is destined to the &alpha;-carotene branch |CITS:[10205893]|.
/
/In photosynthetic tissues, carotenoids generally occur as their stable <i>trans</i> configuration.
/For neoxanthin, however, it would appear that the 9'-<i>cis</i> isomer: |FRAME:CPD-7424|, is favored in

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in the regulation of several crucial physiological and developmental processes in plants, as well as in the adaptative responses to environmental stresses |CITS:[zeevaart88]|.  The regulation of these processes hinges on the size of the bioactive ABA pool.  This pool is thought to be maintained through a finely tuned equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism.  Among the ABA catabolic pathways, the 8'-hydroxylation pathway leading to the formation of phaseic acid (this pathway) appears to be the major regulation point.  Phaseic acid (PA) and its derivative dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) are inactive forms of the hormone.
/
/<b>About this pathway:</b>  The inactivation of ABA to PA involves two steps: the 8'-hydroxylation of ABA to 8'-hydroxy-ABA (8'-OH-ABA) which is in turn converted to PA.  Several cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have been described in the literature that can catalyze the conversion of ABA to 8'-OH-ABA |CITS:[9808729],[15064374],[15044947]|.  So far, these enzymes have demonstrated a requirement for NADPH as electron donor |CITS:[15044947],[15064374]|.  A certain amount of doubt remains as to whether the conversion of 8'-OH-ABA to phaseic acid occurs spontaneously or is the result of an enzymatic activity: indeed, although the reaction appears to occur quickly <i>in vitro</i>, the reaction might require an enzyme <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[milborrow88]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-8117| (GLA) is a polyunsaturated (18:3) &omega;-6 fatty acid (the 6 refers to the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid). It is synthesized from |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| by &Delta;<sup>6</sup> desaturase enzymes. Unlike its precursor, GLA is not an essential fatty acid for animals, since almost all animals possess a &Delta;<sup>6</sup> desaturase enzyme.
/
/GLA is of major importance in animal cells, being the precursor for the synthesis of several &Delta;<sup>6</sup>-desaturated fatty acids, such as |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| and |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5353|).
/&Delta;<sup>6</sup>-desaturated fatty acids have roles in the maintenance of membrane structure and function, in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and transport, in the prevention of water loss from the skin, and as precursors of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leucotrienes |CITS: [1334266]|.
/
/It has been documented that certain organisms, including some plants |CITS:[11170598][16718484]|, filamentous fungi |CITS:[11112411][10570972]| and cyanobacteria |CITS: [8389613][16328883]| can produce substantial portions of |FRAME: CPD-8117|.
/In the plant kingdom, |FRAME: CPD-8117| is only found in a few higher plants (including black currants, evening primrose, borage and hemp), and is usually found exclusively in the seeds.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In all plant tissues, the major glycerolipids are first synthesized using only palmityl (16:0) and oleoyl (18:1) acyl groups, the products of the plastidic saturated fatty acid synthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-5971|, |FRAME: PWY-5989| and |FRAME: PWY-5147|). Subsequent desaturation of the fatty acids to the highly unsaturated forms typical of the membranes of plant cells is carried while they are already attached to lipids.
/
/Most of the oleoyl-[acp] is released from the [acp]-moiety and exported from the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is converted to |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA| in the process by the plastidic |FRAME: AT1G77590-MONOMER|. The |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA| is incorporated into lipids, forming |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE|, |FRAME: Diacylglycerides|, and |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|.
/Further desaturation of the oleoyl groups to linoleoyl groups in the ER occurrs while incorporated into lipids. The first step, which produces |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups|, is catalyzed by the |FRAME: CPLX-1903|, encoded by the |FRAME: AT3G12120| gene. In order to produce a |FRAME: Gamma-linolenoyl-groups|, a second desaturation step is catalyzed by
/|FRAME: MONOMER-12524|.
/
/The enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-13363| has been cloned and expressed in tobacco |CITS: [9108131]|. The desaturase domain of this enzyme is preceeded at the N terminus by a sequence that is related to a cytochrome b5, the electron donor for other ER-located fatty acid desaturases |CITS: [9108131]|.
/Co-expression of the &Delta;<sup>6</sup> desaturase from |FRAME: TAX-13363| and the |FRAME: CPLX-1903| from |FRAME: ORG-5993| in soybean resulted in high accumuolation of |FRAME: CPD-12653| |CITS: [16718484]|.

TYPES - 4-Aminobutyraye-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - 4-aminobutyrate degradation IV
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP-IDA:3486242328:caspi
COMMENT - "<b>General background</b>: 4-aminobutyrate (syn. &gamma;-aminobutyrate - GABA), a non-protein amino acid represents an important component of the free amino acid pool in plants |CITS:[10529826]|. It has been demonstrated that GABA is involved in many physiological incidents in plants such as stress protection, contribution to C:N balance, regulation of cytosolic pH, defense against pathogens, and a role of osmoregulation in the cell (for comprehensive review see |CITS:[15003233]|. In addition a new role has been attributed to GABA, the role of a signaling compound involved in plant glutamate regulation |CITS:[14624837]| |CITS:[15003233]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The degradation of &gamma:-aminobutyrate (also referred to as GABA shunt) comprises basically three enzymatic steps, a decarboyxlation step from glutamate (compare |FRAME:PWY-4321|), a transamination step that converts GABA into succinic semialdehyde followed by a dehydrogenase that forms succinate. Succinate than may enter the |FRAME:PWY-5690| which is a central component of carbohydrate metabolism.
/
/
/The following enzyme, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) can catalyze the turnover of the semialdehyde to succinate either using NAD or NADP as cofactors. So far only the NAD-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase has been identified and characterized in <Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[12740438]| |CITS:[10517851]|. Arabiodpsis mutants deficient in SSADH are characterized by the accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) that causes necrotic lesions and dwarfism. Moreover these plants accumulate &gamma;-hydroxybutyrate a side product which may be the reason for observed aberrant phenotypes indicating a possible relationship between GABA shunt and the occurrence of ROI |CITS:[15642352]|. 
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| is a neurotransmitter inhibitor and is known to lower the blood pressure in humans |CITS: [12627188]|. The foods containing |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| or GABA receives a lot of attention due to their known human health benefits. Wheat germ, wine and chocolate are some of the food products containing |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|. Several plants synthesize GABA under stress conditions such as anaerobic conditions, low pH, low or high temperatures, darkness, and mechanical manipulation.
/GABA in plants provides protection against oxidative stress, and is also involved in pollen growth and development. |FRAME: TAX-4081| plants have relatively higher levels of GABA |CITS: [17955994]|, the molecular mechanism underlying GABA accumulation and catabolism is only now being revealed with several enzymes in this pathways being cloned and characterized |CITS: [18713763]|.
/
/It is currently assumed that the main GABA transaminase in plants utilizes pyruvate rather than 2-ketoglutarate. In |FRAME: TAX-3702|, only the |FRAME: AT3G22200-LER| gene, which encodes a |FRAME: PYRUVATE|-dependent transminase (GABA-TP), have been isolated. In an <i>in vitro</i> study, recombinant Arabidopsis GABA-TP used pyruvate and glyoxylate but not 2;-ketoglutarate as an amine acceptor |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|. The GABA contents in flowers of an Arabidopsis GABA-TP-disrupted mutant were 100-fold higher than those measured in wild-type plants |CITS: [12859897]|.
/Transaminase activity has also been studied in soybean seeds, rice roots, tobacco leaves, radish mature leaves, tomato leaves and potato tubers, and in all of these cases, pyruvate-dependent activities were 1.2-19 times higher than 2-ketoglutarate-dependent activities |CITS: [16658005][Reggiani88][16663565][Shelp95]|.
/
/The dehydrogenases studied from plants so far appear to prefer NAD |CITS: [18713763]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Chlorophyll degradation, corresponding to the loss of green color, is an integral part of leaf senescence and fruit ripening |CITS:[16113212],[15012204],[10767575],[12675736]|.  Chlorophyll degradation may follow one of two routes, likely depending on the physiogical context in which it occurs. This pathway, |FRAME: PWY-6927 chlorophyll <i>a</i> degradation II|, begins in the chloroplast and may be the primary route for chlorophyll degradation in senescing leaves in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| and other species, such as broccoli (|FRAME: TAX-3712 <i>Brassica oleracea</i>|) |CITS: [19304936][20727617]|. Meanwhile, the |FRAME: PWY-5098 chlorophyll <i>a</i> degradation I| pathway may be cytosolic and may operate during fruit senescence and in response to pathogens and wounding |CITS: [15598807][18633118]|.
/
/Both of these pathways appear to lead to the production of a colourless, blue-fluorescing intermediate (primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite or pFCC) <i>via</i> the formation of a red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC).  Following export of pFCC from the chloroplast, the final steps of chlorophyll catabolism are species-specific and involve a diversity of modifications of pFCC before the catabolites are finally stored in the vacuole in the form of |FRAME:NCCS a nonfluorescent chlorophyll catabolite|, or NCCs |CITS:[15012204],[16448336]|.  NCCs share a common tetrapyrrolic skeleton with an oxygenolytically opened porphyrin macrocycle |CITS:[KRAEUTER03]|, with peripheral, species-specific modification at several side chains within different NCCs.  The final conversion of modified FCCs to NCCs is a non-enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the acidic vacuolar pH.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this route of chlorophyll degradation, the magnesium is removed from chlorophyll a prior to the dephytylation step. The first enzyme in this pathway has not been discovered to date, but the |FRAME: AT5G13800-MONOMER pheophyinase| (PPH) enzyme catalyzing the second reaction in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| has been identified and characterized |CITS: [19304936]|. Evidence for this alternative route was collected after it was observed that the two chlorophyllases that catalyze the first step of the |FRAME: PWY-5098 chlorophyll <i>a</i> degradation I| variant pathway are not required for chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| |CITS: [17996203]|. It was also noted that PPH transcript levels are upregulated in senescing Arabidopsis leaves |CITS: [19304936]|.
/
/The next two steps, which are shared by both variant pathways, are decisive in the loss of green colour.  The ring-opening of, and production of the first identifiable colourless product pFCC from pheophorbide <i>a</i> requires two proteins from gerontoplasts membranes and stroma.  Opening of the ring through oxygenolysis of pheophorbide <i>a</i> is catalyzed by the membrane-localized,  nonheme iron-containing monooxygenase, pheophorbide <i>a</i> oxygenase (PaO) which yields red bilin RCC.  This compound is channeled to RCCR which further reduces it to form pFCC.  Both enzymes use reduced ferredoxin as immediate electron donor |CITS:[15012204]|.

COMMENT - In plants, nitrate is an important source of nitrogen. Nitrate assimilation begins with the uptake of nitrate from the soil by the root. Root epidermal and cortical cells 
/are the first to actively transport nitrate into their cytosols. Nitrate then crosses the endodermis of the root and is released into the xylem. After long distance transport up 
/the xylem, nitrate is again actively transported into the cells of the leaf. Once in the cell, nitrate can be stored in the vacuole (due to toxicity) or reduced to nitrite by the enzyme 
/nitrate reductase (NR). Nitrite is transported into the chloroplast, where it is reduced to ammonia by nitrite reductase (NiR). The final step of the pathway is the incorporation 
/of ammonia into glutamine by glutamine synthetase.

COMMON-NAME - <i>ent</i>-kaurene biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - SPONSEL04:EV-EXP:3341327792:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>   The biosynthesis of <i>ent</i>-kaurene represents the first committed step in the biosynthesis of gibberellins in the terpenoid biosynthesis.  As diterpenoids, gibberellins are synthesized from the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which is also an essential precursor in the biosynthesis of several isoprenoids necessary for plant growth and development such as carotenoids, prenyl quinines, chlorophylls and formation of geranygeranylated proteins.  GGPP synthase catalyzes the condensation of IPP (originating, in plants, from the plastidic |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY|) with an allylic prenyl diphosphate FPP to give GGPP.  Cyclization of  the linear GGPP to the tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-kaurene occurs in two steps; first GGPP is converted to the bicyclic compound <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate by an enzyme called copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) which is then converted to <i>ent</i>-kaurene by an <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthase (KS).  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, these enzymes have been shown to be localized in plastids.  In the fungi <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i> and <i>Phaeosphaeria</i> spp. CPS and KS activities reside in the same protein, albeit in separate catalytic sites |CITS:[9268298],[10644675],[10803977]|.  In plants, however, both activities are carried by two separate enzymes.  In <i>Arabidopsis CPS</i> transcripts are present in much lower quantities than those of <i>KS</i> transcripts, indicating that CPS may act as a bottle-neck regulator functioning as a branch point in terpenoid biosynthesis, and committing to the synthesis of <i>ent</i>-kaurenoids and GAs |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This universal pathway is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to |FRAME: TAX-9606|, although
/the input to the pathway, |FRAME:GLT|, is formed by different means in different organisms.
/For example, in mammals, L-glutamate is formed in the mitochondrial matrix by an NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>-dependent
/glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) and transported to the cytoplasm, where the rest of the reactions occur,
/while in bacteria glutamate is formed by a NADP+-dependent enzyme (EC 1.4.1.4).
/
/The first two enzymes, |FRAME: GLUTKIN-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLUTSEMIALDEHYDROG-CPLX|,
/form the |FRAME: PROLINEMULTI-CPLX|. Complex formation is necessary for the activity of the first
/enzyme, but not for the second. The product of the complex,
/|FRAME: L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE|, rearranges spontaneously to form
/|FRAME: L-DELTA1-PYRROLINE_5-CARBOXYLATE|, which is converted to |FRAME:PRO| in a single
/step, catalyzed by |FRAME: PYRROLINECARBREDUCT-CPLX|.

COMMENT - The discovery of |FRAME: NITRIC-OXIDE nitric oxide| (NO) as a crucial signal in plants has enhanced and redirected our understanding of many processes in plant physiology. There has been a surge in investigative studies to understand the biosynthesis of NO in both plants and animals. Plant NO biosynthesis appears to be more complex than animal NO synthesis, as it includes nitrite and |FRAME: ARG L-arginine|-dependent mechanisms. In animals, NO synthases are the main sources of |FRAME: NITRIC-OXIDE nitric oxide|, these complex enzymes oxidize |FRAME: ARG L-arginine| to |FRAME: NITRIC-OXIDE nitric oxide| and |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE L-citrulline| |CITS: [16356941]|. The putative plant NOS isolated from |FRAME: TAX-3702 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>| has no sequence similarity with animal NOS, and, does not, in fact have nitric oxide synthase activity. Nevertheless, its role in NO production has been demonstrated. 
/
/Evidence has accumulated that the NOS in plants are targeted to plastids and are required for ribosome functions, and also indicates it to be a GTPase |CITS: [19168714]|. In other studies, it was demonstrated that the disruption of NOS dependent NO synthesis is associated with salt tolerance in plants like |FRAME: TAX-3702 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>| |CITS: [17351048]|. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4081 <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>|, NOS generated NO acts downstream of auxin and is involved in regulating Fe-deficiency-induced responses as shown in this study |CITS: [21511908 ]|. However, the exact relationship between NO and IAA is not yet clear.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants mainly occurs in plastids, although mitochondria are also capable to 
/synthesize fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|. The active sites for fatty acid biosynthesis are photosynthetic 
/leaf mesophyll cells, seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. In plants, the initial condensation of an 
/acetyl group and a malonyl group to give rise to acetoacetyl-ACP is carried out by the condensing 
/enzyme isoform KAS III. The enzyme specifically uses the substrates acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP. 
/There is no evidence for the existence, or physiological significance if exists, of a bacterial version of 
/the initial condensation reaction, which utilizes acetyl-ACP and 
/malonyl-ACP |CITS:[plantbiochemistry97],[12624762]|. Acetoacetyl-ACP (a beta-ketoacyl-ACP) then 
/enters the elongation cycle, composed of four reactions. One cycle extends the chain length of an 
/acyl-ACP by two carbon units using malonyl-ACP as the carbon donor. The condensing enzyme 
/isoforms KASI and KASII are responsible for elongation steps from C4 to C16, and from C16 to C18, 
/respectively. Unlike their bacterial counterparts, plants KAS I and KAS II do not accept unsaturated 
/acyl-ACP substrates.  
/
/In most plants, the primary products of the fatty acid elongation cycle are 16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP. The 
/first double bond is then introduced to 18:0-ACP by delta9 18:0-ACP desaturase, which is ubiquitous 
/to all plants. Additional double bonds are inserted to oleate and palmitate after they are incorporated 
/into lipids (|FRAME: PWY-782|, |FRAME: PWY-762|). Plants also contain very 
/long-chain fatty acids (chain length larger than 18). The additional chain elongation occurs via the 
/very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5080|) located in the ER. Free fatty acids are 
/released from acyl-ACPs and are exported out of plastids.

COMMON-NAME - palmitate biosynthesis II (bacteria and plants)
CITATIONS - Li10
CITATIONS - DEY97:EV-AS:3444666561:peifenz
COMMENT - Palmitate is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in animals and plants. It was discovered by 
/Edmond Frmy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major component, and was named "palmitique". 
/
/Palmitate is synthesized by stepwise condensation of C2 units to a growing acyl chain. Each elongation cycle results 
/in the addition of two carbons to the acyl chain, and consists of four separate reactions. The first step is the 
/condensation of a C2 unit with the nascent [acp]-bound acyl, forming a beta-ketoacyl-[acp] and CO2. This step is 
/followed by reduction to a (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acp] , dehydration to a trans-delta2-enoyl-acyl-[acp] , and a final 
/reduction to form the elongated fatty acid-[acp]. This chain of event repeats itself several times, until the final 
/product, palmitoyl-[acp] , is formed. 
/
/In plants, condensing enzyme KASI catalyzes the elongation cycle from C4 to C16 carbon length, and uses 
/malonyl-ACP as the donor of C2 units. On the other hand, animals and lower eukaryotes such as yeast use 
/malonyl-CoA as the C2 donor.  
/
/Palmitoyl-[acp] is further extended to stearoyl-[acp] (see |FRAME: PWY-5989|) by condensing enzyme KASII . 
/Additional specific condensing enzymes are required for further chain elongation to synthesize very long chain fatty 
/acids (see |FRAME: PWY-5080|).
/
/The computational annotation and assignment of enzymes and genes to the pathway remain to be curated with literature information.

/Polyisoprenoid alcohols, such as polyisoprenols, are ubiquitous (even though they can be minor components) in membranes of most living organisms from bacteria, plants and mammals.  They are hydrophobic linear polymers, consisting of up to twenty isoprene residues or a hundred carbon atoms (or many more in plants especially), linked head-to-tail, with a hydroxy group at one end (&alpha;-residue) and a hydrogen atom at the other (&omega;-end).  In, polyprenols the &alpha;-residue has a double bond, which distinguishes them from the |FRAME:DOLICHOL|s (or dihydropolyprenols) where the double bond in the &alpha;-residue is hydroxylated.  Polyisoprenoid alcohols are further differentiated by the geometrical configuration of the double bonds into three subgroups: (i) &omega;-di-<i>trans</i>-poly-<i>cis</i>-&alpha;, &omega;-tri-<i>trans</i>-poly-<i>cis</i>-&alpha; (rubber) (both subgroups are represented by the |FRAME:CIS-TRANS-POLYISOPRENYL-PP| branch of this pathway), and &omega;-all-<i>trans</i>-&alpha; (|FRAME:TRANS-POLYISOPRENYL-PP| branch).
/
/For many years, it was assumed that polyprenols were only present in bacteria and plants, especially photosynthetic tissues, whereas dolichols were found in mammals or yeasts, but it is now known that dolichols can also occur at low levels in bacteria and plants and polyprenols in animal cells.  Within a given species, components of one chain-length may predominate, but other homologues are usually present.  The chain length of the main polyisoprenoid alcohols varies from 11 isoprene units in eubacteria, to 16 or 17 in <i>Drosophila</i>, 15 and 16 in yeasts, 19 in hamsters and 20 in pigs and humans. In plants, the range is from 8 to 22 units, but some species of plant have an additional class of polyprenols with up to 5000 units (rubbers |CITS:[10803889]|).  In tissues, polyisoprenoid alcohols can be present in the free form, esterified with acetate or fatty acids, phosphorylated or monoglycosylated phosphorylated (various forms), depending on species and tissue.
/
/In <i>Arabidopsis</i> and many other higher plants, one of the most common <i>trans</i>-polyisoprenol is |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE|, which contains nine isoprene units and is essential in the biosynthesis of plant quinones, such as |FRAME:UBIQUINONE-9| (UQ-9) and |FRAME:PLASTOQUINONE-9| (PQ-9) |CITS:[12437513],[ROBINSON83]|.  Plastoquinone and ubiquinone are known to be major prenylquinones in plants.  Plastoquinone is essential for photosynthetic electron transfer in the chloroplast and ubiquinone is essential for respiratory electron transfer in the mitochondrion.  Both quinones have the isoprenylated tail in the quinone structure moiety and the length of the prenyl side chain differs between species.  Most plants possess nine or 10 units of the isoprenoid side chain of plastoquinone and ubiquinone: <i>Arabidopsis</i> contains PQ-9 and UQ-9.  Two polyprenyl diphosphate synthases catalyzing this reaction have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (SPS1 and SPS2).  SPS1 was shown to catalyze the formation of a range of polyprenyl diphosphate products when incubated in the presence of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| and |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP| or |FRAME:GERANYLGERANYL-PP| |CITS:[15653808]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The superpathway of anthocyanin biosynthesis that originates from cyanidin 
/and cyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside comprises the formation of compounds such as rose anthocyanin, anthocyanidin 
/sophoroside and shisonin. Those anthocyanins are flower pigments that contribute to a wide variation of colors 
/in many species representing various structures that range from simple anthocyanin diglucosides to more 
/complex polyacylated anthocyanins.
/
/<i><b>Rose anthocyanins</i></b> are based on the simple structure of cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside. This anthocyanin 
/is obviously potent enough to provide the wide spectrum of colors found in roses. Like the anthocyanidin 3-glucoside 
/in other plants (compare |FRAME:PWY-5125 anthocyanin biosynthesis (pelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside)|, |FRAME:PWY-5153 anthocyanin biosynthesis (delphinidin 3-O-glucoside)|) the anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside constitutes 
/the first stable anthocyanin in roses and  contributes to its solubility in the vacuole |CITS: [Heller94]| |CITS: [11960739]|. 
/Insofar the pathway described here is unique to the rose family.
/
/Antocyanidins often occur as <i><b>sophoroside</i></b>, i.e. a diglucoside that consists of glucose attached 
/to the 2''-<i>O</i>-position of the 3-<i>O</i>-glucose moiety of anthocyanidins. The anthocyanidin that 
/confers the bright blue color to <i>Ipomoea nil</i> (a member of the Convolvulacea) is a sophoroside that 
/forms a complex with several caffeoyl residues, known as |FRAME:CPD-7841 Wedding Bells Anthocyanin| (HBA). Reddish-brown flowers 
/of dusky mutants of <i>Ipomoea nil</i> contain |FRAME:CPD-7840 Heavenly Blue Antocyanin| (WBA) representing the most favorite 
/flower hue for Japanese floriculturists |CITS: [15842621]|. 
/
/<i><b>Shisonin</i></b>, a mono-malonylated anthocyanin, has been found in high amounts in Labiatae. 
/Together with the bi-malonylated anthocyanin salvianin (|FRAME:PWY-5268 salvianin biosynthesis|) shisonin constitutes a major 
/flower pigment in that genus |CITS: [11809447]|. Both anthocyanins occur predominantly in different species, 
/i.e. shisonin in Perilla |CITS: [12590125]| and salvianin in Salvia |CITS: [Kondo89]| and share key enzymatic 
/steps of their respective biosyntheses comprising glucosylation and aromatic and aliphatic acylation.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/<i><b>Rose anthocyanin</i></b> The formation of cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside in roses is catalyzed by a 
/distinctive enzyme that is able to glucosylate both the flavonoid A-ring 5-<i>O</i>-position and the 
/3-<i>O</i>-position of the flavonoid C-ring. In contrast to the two single glucosyltransferases involved in 
/the generation of anthocyanin 3,5-diglucoside in other plants this unique enzyme possesses both catalytic 
/activities and also changes the order of glucosylation |CITS: [15944692]|. The first intermediate in this 
/pathway is the unstable anthocyanidin-5-<i>O</i>-glucoside which is subsequently further glucosylated 
/to form the stable cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside.
/
/<i><b>Anthocyanin sophoroside</i></b> The crucial step in the formation of anthocyanidin sophoroside 
/as precursors for HBA and WBA in Ipomoea is catalyzed by the anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside 2-<i>O</i>''-glucosyltransferase (3GGT). 
/The enzyme adds glucose to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides at the 2''-<i>O</i>-position of the glucose moiety 
/forming the corresponding sophorosides. Although the enzyme accepts all three major anthocyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside, 
/anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside are not suitable substrates for the 3GGT  |CITS: [15842621]|.
/
/<i><b>Shisonin</i></b> The formation of shisonin, the precursor for the aliphatic acylation with malonyl-CoA 
/to form malonylshisonin is carried out by 3-aromatic acylation of cyanindin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside with 
/p-coumaric acid |CITS: [Fujiwara98]| |CITS: [10845463]| followed by the 5-<i>O</i>-glucosylation of the 
/anthocyanin. The exact biosynthetic route towards shisonin is still a matter of debate and the actual succession 
/of 5-<i>O</i>-glucosylation and 3-<i>O</i>-acylation remains to be demonstrated. The 
/anthocyanin-5-<i>O</i>-glucoside-6'''-<i>O</i>-malonyltransferase |CITS: [12578391]| that produces 
/malonylshisonin expresses a high affinity towards both pelargonidin (salvianin biosynthesis) and cyanidin 
/(shisonin biosynthesis) derived anthocyanidin intermediates forming the corresponding aromatic and aliphatic 
/acylated compounds.

COMMENT - Purine bases and nucleosides released as by-products of cellular metabolism or from the catabolism of nucleic acids can be recycled by plants via a salvage pathway.
/
/|FRAME: GUANOSINE Guanosine| is an intermediate of catabolism of guanine nucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-6606 guanosine nucleotides degradation II|). It can be recycled to guanine nucleotides either directly by guanosine kinase, or via guanine by consequent conversions mediated by guanosine nucleosidase and guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Guanosine may also be converted to xanthosine, which can be used by some plants in
/theobromine or caffeine biosynthesis |CITS: [Ashihara97]|. Alternatively, guanosine can be catabolized in the conventional purine degradation pathway via xanthine.
/In contrast to bacteria which can convert GMP to IMP by GMP reductase, this enzyme activity is not detected in plants |CITS: [Ashihara97]|.
/
/Adenosine can be recycled to adenine nucleotides in similar ways as guanosine. In contrast to animals which primarily recycle adenosine to inosine by adenosine deaminase, most plants do not salvage adenosine via this route since adenosine deaminase is not present in most plants |CITS: [Moffatt02]|. Alternatively, adenine nucleotides are degraded by firstly converting AMP to IMP, catalyzed by AMP deaminase. IMP is further converted to xanthine by alternative routes. Xanthine then enters the conventional purine degradation pathway.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE "Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate"| (PLP, vitamin B6) is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has also been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [11701851]|. 
/
/Some anaerobic bacteria, such as E. coli, synthsize |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE pyridoxal 5'-phosphate| from |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P D-erythrose-4-phosphate| and |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate| in a multistep pathway, as described in |FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY pyridoxal 5'-phosphate biosynthesis I|. However, most bacteria, as well as archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single complex reaction, as described in here. 
/
/The reaction is catalyzed by the |FRAME: CPLX-8031 pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase complex|, a dimeric complex that includes two different subunits |CITS: [16030023]|. The |FRAME: MONOMER-15503 "glutamine hydrolase"| subunit (encoded by |FRAME: G-11883 pdxT|) catalyzes the hydrolysis of |FRAME: GLN L-glutamine|, producing |FRAME: GLT L-glutamate| and |FRAME: AMMONIA ammonia| |CITS: [14585832]|. The ammonia is not released from the enzyme - instead, it is channeled to the active site of the |FRAME: MONOMER-15502 "synthase subunit"| (|FRAME: G-11882 pdxS|) by a 100&Aring; tunnel.
/
/The synthase subunit (Pdx1, |FRAME: G-11882 pdxS|) condenses the ammonium with |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P D-ribose-5-phosphate| and |FRAME: GAP D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate| in a complex series of reactions and produces |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE pyridoxal 5'-phosphate| |CITS: [18271580]|.
/
/The purified proteins have been used <i>in vitro</i> in a reconstituted system |CITS: [15771487]|, and a detailed model for the enzyme's mechanism has been suggested |CITS: [17189272][18271580][18260082][18516049]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The homeostasis of glycerophospholipids constitutes an indispensable element for buildup, maintenance and component dynamics of cell membranes in all organisms. The many different phospholipid molecular species found in yeast basically vary in their composition of fatty acids esterified to the sn-1 and sn-2 position of a phosphorylated |FRAME:GLYCEROL| and a head group which can either be a |FRAME:CHOLINE|, |FRAME:ETHANOL-AMINE|, |FRAME:SER|, |FRAME:MYO-INOSITOL| or the one phospholipid without a head group, i.e. phosphatidate (for example |FRAME:CPD-8291|) |CITS:[14321173] [22345606]|. After the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of phospholipids in the Kennedy pathway (see |FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|, |FRAME:PWY3O-450|) glycerophospholipids can be degraded (see |FRAME:LIPAS-PWY|) and remodeled (this pathway; see also |FRAME:PWY-7409| and |FRAME:PWY-7417|). The latter has been proposed by William E.M. Lands |CITS:[14413818]| who describes in the eponymous 'Lands cycle' a de-acylation-re-acylation process of phospholipids typically characterized by saturated acyl chains at the sn-1 and unsaturated acyl chains at the sn-2 position |CITS:[7871882]|.
/
/This remodeling process starts with the de-acylation at the sn-2 position of phospholipids catalyzed by phospholipases (e.g. phospholipase A2) generating the corresponding lyso-phospholipids. The resulting lyso-phospholipids represent the substrates for acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phospholipid acyltransferases or phospholipid transacylases which can re-acylate the sn-2 position. Generally, the Lands cycle constitutes an exchange of fatty acids at the sn-2 position which is an substantial factor in the maintenance of the homeostasis of phospholipids |CITS:[17010666]|. This de- and re-acylation process translates into many physiological functions, for example increasing membrane fluidity through a higher percentage of unsaturated acyl chains, re-esterification of exogenous lyso-phospholipids |CITS:[17726007]|, buffering excess toxic fatty acids |CITS:[22090344] [19608739]| and maintenance of the intrinsic membrane curvature necessary to preserve membrane integrity |CITS:[16339082] [31173]|.
/
/In the phosphatidylcholine remodeling pathway the de-acylation of |FRAME:1-2-DIPALMITOYLPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| is catalyzed by the phospholipase A2 activity of the triacylglycerol lipase TGL4p |CITS:[16135509] [16267052] [20332534]| whereas the re-acylation of |FRAME:CPD-8343| is carried out by the acyl-CoA dependent lyso-phosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (TAZ1p) |CITS:[9930410] [15588229]|. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a very dominant phospholipid species in membranes of most eukaryotic organisms |CITS:[17010666]| and as such its homeostasis must be under a very tight control to ensure the proper functioning of cell membranes |CITS:[16339082]|.

/In plants, PLP is known as cofactor of various key enzymes which play a role in ethylene biosynthesis |CITS:[10557240]|, chlorophyll and tetrapyrrole synthesis |CITS:[12767809]|, <i>de novo</i> sphingolipid biosynthesis |CITS:[11171191]| and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS:[6778873]|. Moreover, vitamers have been shown to have antioxidant properties impeding the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are considered to be involved in stress response pathways |CITS:[10687384]| |CITS:[17227548]| |CITS:[19903353]| |CITS:[19145213]|. 
/
/The vitamin B6 salvage pathway for plants is very similar to the bacterial variant (see |FRAME:PLPSAL-PWY|). Three enzymes from plants catalyzing main reactions in the salvage pathway have been characterized so far. The non-phophorylated vitamers PL, PN, and PM are phosphorylated to PLP, PNP, and PMP through pyridoxal kinase(s). So far the phosphorylation of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| to |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| has been demonstrated in wheat and |FRAME:TAX-3701|. Although not tested as substrates in these experiments it is expected that the pyridoxal kinase works likewise with |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE| |CITS:[12244454]| |CITS:[15499907]|. The reverse reactions catalyzed by phosphatases have been suggested based on homologues of microbial and animal genes that exist in plant genomes but no enzymes have been reported yet. The formed phosphorylated vitamers, i.e. |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE-5P| and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| are converted to |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| by the catalytic action of pyridoxine/pyrimidine 5'-phosphate oxidases |CITS:[17224143]| |CITS:[7138019]|. In addition, a pyridoxal reductase from |FRAME:TAX-3701| has been purified that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| to |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| |CITS:[21533842]|. Hence, it appears that plants, with the vitamin B6 salvage pathway, maintain pools of the various vitamers and possess the ability to generate and recycle non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms which upon demand generate the active vitamin B6 |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE|.

COMMENT - In plants the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, can be broken down. The end 
/products of the catabolic pathways, acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA and acetoacetate, enter the TCA cycle to 
/generate energy. The branched-chain amino acids promote their own degradations, but only during 
/seed germination, senescence, or under sugar starvation. It suggests the degradation pathways provide 
/alternative carbon sources for the plant during severe conditions. In addition, the branched-chain amino 
/acids and their derived alpha-keto acids are cytotoxic. Thus the degradation pathways may be an 
/important detoxification mechanism to prevent their build-up.
/
/Degradation of the three branched-chain amino acids shares the same enzymes for the initial steps.  
/
/All the Arabidopsis enzymes for leucine degradation have been detected in mitochondria|CITS: [14764908]|, suggesting 
/a mitochondrial location of the pathway. A few later step enzymes for isoleucine and valine degradation 
/were not detected in this organelle. Rather, they were found in peroxisomes. It is possible that the 
/degradation of isoleucine and valine spans mitochondria and peroxisomes in Arabidopsis|CITS: [14764908]|. 
/In some other plants including mung bean and sunflower, isolated peroxisomes can convert 
/labeled branched-chain amino acids to propionyl- and acetyl-CoAs. It indicates peroxisomes could 
/be the sole location of branched-chain amino acid degradation pathways in certain species|CITS: [16666252], [16667190]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Many metabolic processes, including respiration, photosynthetic electron transport and oxidation of glycolate in 
/photorespiration, generate active oxygen species such as singleton oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The toxic 
/singleton oxygen and hydrogen peroxide can damage membrane lipids and certain enzymes and thus interrupt the 
/cell function. The ascorbate-glutathione cycle scavenges hydrogen peroxide. In this cycle, ascorbate and 
/glutathione are not consumed. They transfer reducing power from NADPH and reduce hydrogen peroxide to H2O. 
/Hydrogen peroxide is reduced to H2O by ascorbate peroxidase using ascorbate, which generates 
/monodehydroascorbate. Monodehydroascorbate is a radical. It can be reduced to ascorbate by 
/monodehydroascorbate reductase. If not reduced rapidly, monodehydroascorbate is disproportionated into 
/ascorbate and dehydroascorbate. Dehydroascorbate is reduced to ascorbate by dehydroascorbate reductase 
/using reduced glutathione as the reducing agent. Oxidized glutathione is in-turn reduced by glutathione reductase 
/using NADPH. 
/
/
/The ascorbate-glutathione cycle presents in at least four different subcellular locations including the cytosol, 
/chloroplast, mitochondrion and peroxisome. Studies of the Arabidopsis enzymes of the pathway show that the 
/same set of enzymes, including ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione 
/reductase, are dual targeted to chloroplast and mitochondrion|CITS: [12954611]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite that plays important roles in many aspects of metabolism. In plant 
/cells, there are at least four distinct acetyl-CoA pools in different subcellular compartments, the cytosol, 
/the mitochondrion, the plastid, and the microbody. Each pool is used in the biosynthesis of distinct 
/metabolites in the corresponding subcellular location. The cytosolic acetyl-CoAs are substrates for the 
/synthesis of many secondary metabolites including flavonoids and terpenoids, and very long chain fatty 
/acids which are themselves substrates for storage lipids and cuticle waxes. The mitochondrial 
/acetyl-CoAs feed into the TCA cycle for the generation of energy and reducing power. The plastid 
/acetyl-CoAs serve as precursors of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. In the glyoxysome, acetyl-CoAs 
/generated from the breakdown of storage lipids are converted to carbohydrates via the glyoxylate cycle 
/and gluconeogenesis. 
/
/Research advances in the recent years have addressed questions concerning where the individual 
/acetyl-CoA pools are made from, especially for the mitochondrial, plastid and cytosolic pools. In the 
/mitochondrion and plastid, acetyl-CoA is derived from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 
/composed of three enzyme activities, pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase, and 
/dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. Pyruvate is generated from glycolysis in the cytosol which then enters 
/the mitochondrion. In the plastid, pyruvate is generated from the Calvin cycle. Plants have two forms 
/of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, one in the plastid and the other in the mitochondrion. The two 
/complexes differ in many aspects of enzyme characteristics and regulations. In the cytosol, acetyl-CoA 
/is generated from citrate, which itself is derived from the TCA cycle and exported out of the 
/mitochondrion. The conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by citrate-ATP lyase. This enzyme 
/activity has only been detected in plants and vertebrates.

CITATIONS - CURATOR11
COMMENT - Isoprenoids are among the most diverse and widely distributed natural compounds. They include both essential products (sterols, quinones, prenylated proteins, chlorophylls) and secondary metabolites (plant terpenoids and hormones) |CITS: [15024605]|.
/
/In this pathway |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP all-<i>trans</i>-geranyl-geranyl diphosphate| and multiple units of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP isopentenyl diphosphate| (IPP) undergo a series of polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain of nine units, known as |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE all-<i>trans</i>-nonaprenyl diphosphate| or solanesyl diphosphate.
/
/In most organisms, the enzyme that adds the isoprenyl units to form |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE all-<i>trans</i>-nonaprenyl diphosphate| prefers |FRAME: GERANYL-PP geranyl diphosphate|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-5805 nonaprenyl diphosphate biosynthesis I|. However, the enzymes found in |FRAME: TAX-3702 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>| were shown to prefer |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP all-<i>trans</i>-geranyl-geranyl diphosphate| |CITS: [12437513]|. A view of the pathway starting from the less favored substrate of FPP is depicted in |FRAME: PWY-5805-ARA|.
/
/Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by the specific synthase. Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules, such as quinones. However, the enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a preference towards a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone
/molecule is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/Quinones with nine isoprenyl units in the side chains are very common. They are the predominant form of plastoquinones, found in green plants and cyanobacteria, and are the major quinones in some large Gram-negative and Gram-positive genera, including the Pseudomonads and the Streptococci. Nine-isoprenyl quinones are also found in many animals, including the rat.
/
/|FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| possesses two alleles of solanesyl diphosphate synthases - |FRAME: AT1G17050 SPS2| supplies the precursor of the plastoquinone side-chain, while |FRAME: AT1G78510 SPS1| contributes to the biosynthesis of the ubiquinone side-chain |CITS: [15784989]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The glycolysis pathway represented here is also known as the '<i>Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway</i>'.  First identified in yeast cells and mammalian tissue, it is now also seen as the 'central' metabolic pathway in plants, and can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.  Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions: i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.  The ultimate purpose of the pathway is to convert carbon in its reduced form in storage carbohydrates (e.g. |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, |FRAME:Starch| and simpler carbohydrates such as |FRAME:SUCROSE|, |FRAME:D-Glucose| and |FRAME:D-Galactose|).  In plants, glycolysis is the predominant pathway fueling respiration (see |FRAME:TCA|) because, unlike animal mitochondria, plant mitochondria rarely respire fatty acids.  In plants, this pathway occurs in two different subcellular locations: the cytosol and plastids, which are the sites of |FRAME:PWY-621| and |FRAME: PWY-6724|, respectively.  Whereas the <i>plastidic</i> glycolysis pathway (see |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS|) is identical to the conventional microbial glycolysis, the <i>cytosolic</i> pathway (i.e. this pathway) is slightly modified.  These pathways can interact with one another though the action of highly selective transporters present in the inner plastid envelope |CITS:[Emes93]|.  In chloroplasts in the dark, as well as in plastids of non-photosynthetic tissues, the primary function of |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS| is the degradation of |FRAME:Starch| to generate carbon skeletons, reductants and ATP for anabolic pathways such as that of |FRAME:PWY-4381| via |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|.  In the cytosol, the same products are generated from the degradation of |FRAME:SUCROSE|.
/
/The pathway starts with |FRAME:GLC-6-P|, which is made available from a variety of sources (in the plant plastids, it results from |FRAME: PWY-6724|).  The first committed step of glycolysis is the reversible conversion of |FRAME:GLC-6-P| into |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| by an hexose phosphate isomerase, which changes the pyranose configuration of glucose into the furanose configuration of fructose.  The second step is catalyzed by a phosphofructokinase in the presence of |FRAME:ATP|; this step is irreversible (in the cytosol of plants, see |FRAME:PWY-621|, an alternative enzyme uses |FRAME:PPI| instead of ATP).  The third step is catalyzed by an aldolase which cleaves |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE| into interconvertable (they are keto-enol tautomers) two three-carbon fragments: |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|.  The interconversion of these tautomers is facilitated by a triose phosphate isomerase.  The following reaction, which adds one phosphate residue to |FRAME:GAP| to form |FRAME:DPG|, is freely reversible and requires |FRAME:NAD| and |FRAME:Pi|.  The next step releases one molecule of ATP during the conversion of |FRAME:DPG| into |FRAME:G3P| by a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate kinase.  The next step requires little energy change and leads to the reversible transfer of a phosphate group from the 3- to the 2-hydroxyl group of glycerate, leading to the formation of |FRAME:2-PG|.  The removal of a molecule of water by an enolase in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> converts |FRAME:2-PG| into |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|.  The final step of glycolysis involves the ketolization of |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| to |FRAME:PYRUVATE| by a pyruvate kinase, leading to the release of a molecule of ATP.
/
/In the cytosol, there are two alternative reactions to the plastidic pathway: EC 2.7.1.90 and EC 1.2.1.9.  The former represents an alternative to EC 2.7.1.11; this reaction utilizes |FRAME:PPI| rather than ATP to convert |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P| to |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE|.  The plant cytosol lacks soluble inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatases (PPiases) and, consequently, contains higher concentrations of |FRAME:PPI| (up to 0.3 mM |CITS:[WEINER87]|).  It has been proposed that the utilization of pyrophosphate rather than that of ATP in glycolysis is favored under nutritional <i>Pi</i> deprivation or oxygen deficiency |CITS:[DAVIES93],[15012287]|.  The latter reaction, EC 1.2.1.9, provides a bypass between |FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:G3P|, which allows for their conversion without phosphorylation by a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase |CITS:[15012287],[16927206]|.  This reaction produces |FRAME:NADPH| but not |FRAME:ATP|.
/
/The overall process, which requires the initial investment of one molecule of ATP to produce |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-16-DIPHOSPHATE|, yields four molecules of ATP and two molecules of |FRAME:NADH| for every molecule of hexose fed to the system.  The fate of the final product of glycolysis, |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, depends on the state of the oxygen supply and can be consumed, for example, by the |FRAME:TCA| via the formation |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| in aerobic conditions, or degraded to ethanol or lactate under anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME:PWY-3801|).

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Fatty acid biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms is carried out in independent, dual cellular locations, the cytosol with fatty acid synthase (FAS) complexes (FAS I type) synthesizing fatty acids |CITS:[6137188] [16950653]| (for example |FRAME:PWY-5994|) and the mitochondria where monofunctional enzymes encoded in the yeast nucleus catalyze the various steps of fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS II type) |CITS:[19028688] [9187370]|. The latter resembles the bacterial FAS II system (see |FRAME:PWY0-501|, |FRAME:PWY0-1275|) but except for |FRAME:CPD-195|, the precursor for |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| |CITS:[9218413]|, the functions of other final products made by the pathway remain unclear and require further research |CITS:[19028688]|.
/
/It has been speculated that the main purpose of mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis lies in the maintenance of mitochondria |CITS:[11509667]| and respiration |CITS:[16246072]| which is closely connected to |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| biosynthesis and incorporation |CITS:[9037098] [9218413] [18779316]| but may also contribute fatty acids as constituent of mitochondrial phospholipid membranes |CITS:[Schneider95]|. In addition, novel links have been proposed to exist between mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and RNA processing where products from the mitochondrial FAS II pathway are required for RNase P activity in yeast which in turn is controlled by positive feedback mechanisms |CITS:[18779316] [19686777]|.
/
/The mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis type II is characterized by six enzymatic steps which produce an acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP). This acyl-ACP is condensed with |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| formed in the first two steps of the pathway which elongates the acyl chain by two carbons. The cycle is repeated until the final fatty acid has been produced |CITS:[18779316]|. The first and crucial enzymatic step in the pathway is the formation of mitochondrial |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| by the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase encoded by HFA1 |CITS:[14761959] [7906156] [Sickmann03]|. HFA1 is the mitochondrial counterpart of the cytoplasmatic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC1) also producing |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| which is however unable to permeate the membrane barrier of the mitochondria. The following conversion of |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| to  |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| is catalyzed by the malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCT1) |CITS:[9388293]|. In a condensation reaction with either |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| or |FRAME:ACETYL-ACP|, |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| is converted to |FRAME:Acetoacetyl-ACPs| carried out by the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase (CEM1) |CITS:[8412701] [7988550]| which is the initiating reaction into the cycle as well as the elongating reaction once the cycle has been run. 
/
/The subsequent reduction to |FRAME:Beta-3-hydroxybutyryl-ACPs| by the 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (OAR1) |CITS:[9388293] [14562095]| is followed by the dehydration reaction that produces |FRAME:Crotonyl-ACPs| |CITS:[15387819]|. The catalyzing 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HTD2) differs from the prior enzymes in the pathway by a lack of homology to the corresponding prokaryotic enzyme. The final step in the pathway is also catalyzed by an enzyme which shows no obvious homology to its bacterial counterpart. The enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (ETR1) catalyzes the formation of the end product of the first fatty acid synthesis II cycle, i.e. |FRAME:Butanoyl-ACPs| |CITS:[11509667] [12614607]| which after condensation with |FRAME:MALONYL-ACP| and required repetition of the cycle will produce |FRAME:OCTANOYL-ACP|, the precursor for |FRAME:LIPOIC-ACID| biosynthesis (see |FRAME:PWY-7381|, |FRAME:PWY-7382|, |FRAME:PWY-7386|).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/L-Rhamnose is a component of the plant cell wall pectic polysaccharides rhamnogalacturonan I and rhamnogalacturonan II and is also present in diverse secondary metabolites incliding anthocyanins, flavonoids and triterpenoids.
/Rhamnosyl transferases have been shown to utilize UDP-&beta;-L-rhamnose as the donor substrate |CITS: [1939145 ], [15020741]|, although in mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>), both dTDP-&beta;-L-Rhamnose and UDP-&beta;-L-rhamnose were reported to act as sugar donors for the rhamnosylation of flavonoids |CITS: [13864832 ]|.
/In general UDP-D-glucose is used in plants rather than dTDP-D-glucose as a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of L-rhamnose.
/
/<b>Pathway Characteristics:</b>
/
/Although the biosynthesis of UDP-L-rhamnose from UDP-D-glucose in <i>Arabidopsis</i> is thought to occur in one step through trifunctional enzymes (see reaction |FRAME:RXN-5482|) |CITS:[11554483]|, a second route has been postulated which presumes two enzymatic steps: first the conversion of UDP-D-glucose into UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-L-mannose via an unidentified UDP-D-glucose-4,6-dehydratase followed by a final conversion to UDP-L-rhamnose via NRS/ER, an enzyme which has been shown to be able to catalyse <i>in vitro</i> the conversion of UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-L-mannose into UDP-L-rhamnose |CITS: [15020741]|.  To date RHM1 (a paralog of MUM4 which has been postulated to have the trifunctional activity mention hereabove) has been shown to possess a dehydratase domain that can catalyze the conversion of UDP-D-glucose into the reaction intermediate |FRAME:CPD-663|; the enzyme could not however be fully expressed in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS:[16766693]|.

COMMENT - Jasmonates are an important class of compounds, related to |FRAME:Jasmonic-Acids "jasmonic acid"|, found in many, if not all, plant species.
/These compounds may participate in a number of biological processes including resistance to herbivores and some
/pathogens, senescence, reproductive development, and protection against ozone
/(reviewed in |CITS:[19025383][16807821][17513307]|). 
/
/Many different jasmonate precursors and jasmonate derivatives, including |FRAME:CPD-11253| (12-OHJA) and
/|FRAME: 12-Hydroxyjasmonate-Sulfates| (12-OHJA sulfate) have been identified throughout the plant kingdom |CITS:[ 17995915]|.
/No biological activity has been attributed to the sulfated 12-OHJA derivative. Unlike the active compound, methyl
/JA, |FRAME: 12-Hydroxyjasmonate-Sulfates| does not inhibit germination or root elongation in tomato seedlings |CITS: [17995915]|.
/Moreover, this is not likely to be a hydrolyzable storage form of hydroxyjasmonate because the Arabidopsis genome
/is not predicted to encode sulfatases |CITS:[12637544]|. The biological relevance of 12-OHJA is more ambiguous.
/|FRAME: CPD-11253| behaves the same as |FRAME: 12-Hydroxyjasmonate-Sulfates| in root growth and germination assays in tomato,
/suggesting that it is also biologically inactive in that species |CITS:[17995915]|. However, 12-OHJA
/can induce tuber formation in potatoes |CITS:[HELDER93]|. 12-OHJA also prompts distinct sets of transcriptional changes
/when compared to other jasmonates in tomato |CITS:[17995915]|.
/Neither of these compounds has been functionally characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
/
/Two enzymes are required for this biological pathway. To date, no hydroxylase capable of catalyzing the formation of
/ |FRAME:CPD-11253| or |FRAME: 11-Hydroxyjasmonates| have been identified. But, in vitro analyses have led to the indentification
/of an enzyme, |FRAME:AT5G07010-MONOMER|, capable of acting on both these substrates |CITS:[12637544]|.
/As seen with other aspects of the JA biosynthetic pathway, there may be multiple levels of regulation
/controlling the synthesis of these compounds. For example, transcript levels of the ST2A enzyme are up-regulated
/by its substrate, |FRAME:CPD-11253| indicating a possible feed-forward loop to tightly regulate the level
/of  free 12-OHJA in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[12637544]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE| (AIR) is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of
/purine nocleotides and thiamine.
/It is synthesized from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) in 5 steps, catalyzed by the enzymes

/
/In most organisms the third step is catalyzed by a folate-dependent |FRAME:GART-ENZRXN|.
/However, |FRAME:TAX-562| the has two enzymes that catalyze this step - a folate-dependent |FRAME: GART-MONOMER| that utilizes |FRAME: 10-FORMYL-THF|, as well as a  |FRAME: FORMATE|-utilizing |FRAME: GARTRANSFORMYL2-MONOMER|.  These two enzymes share little homology.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: UDP-GLUCOSE|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here is similar to pathway |FRAME: PWY-7184| with the exception of the |FRAME: RXN-8850 "flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase reaction"| |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.148 "EC 2.1.1.148"| (catalyzed by ThiX), which substitutes for the more common |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-RXN "thymidylate synthase reaction"| |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "EC 2.1.1.45"| (catalyzed by ThiA).
/
/In 2002 it was discovered that some organisms do not posses the <i>thyA</i> gene (named TYMS in animals), and instead have an alternate, novel |FRAME: CPLX-8096| encoded by gene <i>thyX</i>.
/
/Both thymidylate synthases catalyze a reductive methylation involving the transfer of the methylene group of |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| to the C5-position of |FRAME: DUMP| and a two electron reduction of the methylene group to a methyl group. However, the reductive mechanisms of ThyA and ThyX are distinctly different. The ThyA reductive mechanism uses folate as both a 1-carbon donor and a source of reducing equivalents, producing |FRAME: DUMP| and |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE| as products, and does not involve a flavin coenzyme or a third substrate. In contrast, the ThyX mechanism uses a flavin coenzyme as a source of reducing equivalents, which are derived from NADPH.  This NAD(P)H oxidase uses |FRAME: FAD| to mediate hydride transfer in a methylation reaction that results in |FRAME: THF| as a product, rather than the |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE| that is produced by ThyA. The chemical and kinetic mechanisms of ThyX and progress in the design of specific inhibitors are reviewed in |CITS: [19643076]|.  Inhibitor design has been specifically addressed in |CITS: [17216455] [18513963]|.
/
/Homologs of the <i>thyX</i> gene have been identified in some eubacterial, archaeal, slime mold and viral genomes |CITS: [12029065]|. The genomes of some of these organisms contain only <i>thyX</i>, while others, such as those of |FRAME:TAX-1763| and |FRAME:TAX-1716| species, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1765| and |FRAME: TAX-196627| contain both <i>thyA</i> and <i>thyX</i>. The two proteins may function under different phases of the growth cycle (in |CITS: [20636973] [12029065] [12193646] [16707489] [17890305]| and reviewed in |CITS: [12029066] [15046578] [19643076]|).
/
/
/Because ThyX is found in some important human and animal pathogens, it is of interest as a drug target |CITS: [17216455]|.  Some of the bacterial pathogens that appear to posses only ThyX include |FRAME: TAX-210|, |FRAME: TAX-197|, |FRAME: TAX-782|, |FRAME: TAX-139|, |FRAME: TAX-160|, |FRAME: TAX-83558|, |FRAME: TAX-83554| and |FRAME: TAX-813| (in |CITS: [12029065] [12791256]|). Other bacteria that posses only ThyX include |FRAME: TAX-1061| |CITS: [17890305]| and the hyperthermophiles |FRAME: TAX-2336| and |FRAME: TAX-63363| |CITS: [15046578]|.
/
/Some archaea apparently posses only ThyX and others only ThyA.  Those with only ThyX include |FRAME: TAX-56636|, |FRAME: TAX-13773|, |FRAME: TAX-29292|, |FRAME: TAX-2261|, |FRAME: TAX-53953|, |FRAME: TAX-2303|, |FRAME: TAX-50339|, |FRAME: TAX-2287| and |FRAME: TAX-111955| |CITS: [12029065] [15046578]|, and |FRAME: TAX-2242| |CITS: [12423760]|. Conversely, archaea that possess only ThyA include |FRAME: TAX-2234|, |FRAME: TAX-2190|, |FRAME: TAX-2320|, and |FRAME: TAX-145262| |CITS: [15046578]|. It should be noted that many archaea do not contain the substrate tetrahydrofolate as shown in these pathways, and utilize chemically modified tetrahydromethanopterins instead |CITS: [15046578]|.
/
/ThyX shows no sequence homology with ThyA and substantially differs from ThyA in crystal structure and reaction mechanism.  Evidence has been presented that ThyX is less catalytically efficient than ThyA and it may limit chromosomal replication in bacteria and archaea that posses it |CITS: [18621705]|.

CITATIONS - PMNUPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Purine nucleotides participate in many aspects of cellular metabolism including the structure of DNA and RNA, serving as enzyme cofactors, functioning in cellular signaling, acting as phosphate group donors, and generating cellular energy.  Maintenance of the proper balance of intracellular pools of these nucleotides is critical to normal function.  This occurs through a combination of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis and salvage pathways for pre-existing purine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway for purine nucleotides is highly conserved among organisms, but its regulation and the organization of the genes encoding the enzymes vary. This fourteen step pathway contains ten steps that branch at |FRAME: IMP| to form |FRAME: AMP| and |FRAME: GMP|, each in two steps. Regulation of the pathway has been well studied in microbes such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-1423|</i> and |FRAME:TAX-4932|, but little is known about its regulation in higher eukaryotes (metazoa and plants |CITS: [8938402]|). The pathway appears to vary in archaea |CITS: [9150241]|. Some organisms, such as the mycoplasmas, do not biosynthesize purine and pyrimidine bases <i>de novo</i> and must rely on salvage pathways |CITS: [11737647]|.   
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4932| regulation of the pathway occurs at both the enzyme level as shown in this pathway, and at the genetic level. For example, at the genetic level positive-acting regulatory proteins Bas1 and Pho2 and biosynthetic intermediates |FRAME: P-RIBOSYL-4-SUCCCARB-AMINOIMIDAZOLE| and/or |FRAME: AICAR| are required to derepress <i>ADE</i> gene expression.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: GLYCEROL Glycerol| uptake in bacteria is mediated by the glycerol diffusion facilitator, an integral membrane protein catalyzing the rapid equilibration of concentration gradients of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [8436953]|. Intracellular glycerol is converted to |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses ATP as phosphoryl donor. |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P "Glycerol-3-P"| is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator and thus remains in the cell, where it is further metabolized. As a result, the driving force for the uptake of glycerol is generated by the phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase |CITS: [9162046]|. 
/
/While |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| can not leave the cytoplasm, it can be imported into the cell by the GlpT transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, that couples the import of glycerol-3-P into the cytoplasm to the export of inorganic phosphates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm |CITS: [3522583][12893936]|. 
/
/In addition, |FRAME:TAX-562| K12 possesses two systems the salvage of |FRAME: Glycerophosphodiesters "glycerophosphoryl diesters"|, the Glp system and the Ugp system. 
/
/In the Glp system, the |FRAME: EG10399| gene encodes a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (periplasmic GDP) which hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to an alcohol and |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| . The latter is then transported into the cell by the GlpT transporter. Periplasmic GDP is specific for the glycerophospho- moiety of the substrate, while the alcohol can be any one of several alcohols. This provides the cell with the capability of channeling a wide variety of glycerophosphodiesters into the <i>glpQT</i>-encoded dissimilatory system.
/
/In the Ugp system the diesters are hydrolyzed during transport at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| and an alcohol by a cytoplasmic GDP, an enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: EG11050| gene. 
/The Ugp system is induced when the cells are starved for inorganic phospate, which is  generates phosphate by the system |CITS: [1851953]|.
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| can be further metabolized to |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| by either of two membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic |FRAME: AERGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| (encoded by the |FRAME: EG10394| gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|.  
/Under anaerobic conditions, a different |FRAME: ANGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| is preferentially expressed. This tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the <i>glpACB</i> operon, channels the electrons from |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|.

COMMENT - Cysteine biosynthesis represents the final step of sulfate assimilatory reduction and the sole entry 
/point of reduced sulfur into an organic form in plants. Serine provides the amino acid backbone for 
/cysteine synthesis which proceeds via the acetyl-activated intermediate O-acetylserine. Cysteine is not 
/only a protein constituent, but a substrate for methionine biosynthesis, and a precursor for the synthesis 
/of essential molecules such as glutathione, thiamine, biotin and coenzyme A. Both enzymes and the 
/whole pathway occur in plastids, cytosol, and mitochondria. There are possible cross-talk and 
/compensation of cysteine biosynthesis among the three subcellular locations|CITS: [17293560]|.  
/
/Regulation mechanisms (reviewed in|CITS: [16386330]|):
/SAT activity limits the rate of cysteine formation. The cytosolic SAT isoforms are feedback inhibited by 
/cysteine. In addition, SAT activity is regulated via the cysteine synthase complex (CSC) which consists 
/of a dimmer of homotrimer SAT and a homodimer OAS-TL. By forming the complex, SAT becomes 
/active whereas OAS-TL becomes inactive. When sulfide is in limited supply and OAS accumulates, it 
/triggers the dissociation of the CSC complex. Thus SAT becomes inactive and consequently the 
/consumption of serine and acetyl-CoA stops. 
/
/The Arabidopsis genome contains five SAT genes and nine OAS-TL genes. SAT1, 3 and 5 are the 
/predominantly expressed isoforms. The high Km of SAT2 and 4 suggests these two isoforms not likely 
/important for cysteine biosynthesis in vivo|CITS: [15579666]|. OAS-TL A1, B and C are the three most 
/expressed OAS-TL genes and the activities of the three isoforms have been characterized|CITS: [10940562]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Anthocyanins are water-soluble, secondary plant products that constitute a 
/major subgroup (about 15 to 20%) of flavonoids |CITS: [Andersen06]|. Almost all vascular plants possess 
/basic anthocyanins such as pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and cyaniding-3-O-glucoside (this pathway) responsible 
/for the red to magenta coloration of flowers and fruits and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside introducing blue tones 
/to the floral organs of plants |CITS: [11130659]|.
/
/Anthocyanins play important roles as pigments of flowers and fruits in numerous plants across the plant 
/kingdom to attract insects for pollination and act as protectants against UV-B irradiation |CITS: [14561507]|. 
/They also exhibit anti-oxidant activities and therefore may serve as potential anticancer |CITS: [16084717]| 
/and anti-arteriosclerosis compounds in human health |CITS: [15282635]| |CITS: [12828368]| |CITS: [11960739]|. 
/Anthocyanines constitute biological active metabolites that also modulate inter-species relationships being 
/intimately connected with the co-existence of plants with, e.g. insects, mammals, and birds |CITS: [11820759]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: 
/<b>Enzymes</b>: The crucial step in this pathway is the oxidation of leucoanthocyanidins to generate respective 
/cyanidins. Despite of intensive research over the last years (e.g. |CITS: [14552794]| |CITS: [16106293]|)  this enzymatic 
/step is still not completely understood and requires further study. Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), a 2-oxoglutarate 
/iron-dependent oxygenase, catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the anthocyanin class of 
/flavonoids |CITS: [11796114]|. Anthocyanidin synthase catalyzes the <i>in vitro</i> conversion of leucoanthocyanidins 
/to dihydroflavonol and flavonol intermediates (<i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-isoforms) and to a minor degree 
/anthocyanidins |CITS: [Turnbull00]|. In addition, (+)-catechin was found to be accepted by the ANS forming 
/a 4,4-dimer of the oxidized (+)-catechin |CITS: [16494872]|. 
/
/The formation of colored anthocyanidins such as pelargonidin and cyanidin from colorless leucoanthocyanidins 
/(leucopelargonidin, leucocyanidin) was detected by the ANS-catalyzed reaction in the presence of ferrous ion, 
/2-oxoglutarate and ascorbate, being followed by acidification with HCI |CITS: [10074715]|. It has been shown 
/that recombinant ANSs from several model plant species, snapdragon, petunia, torenia, and maize, catalyze 
/the formation of anthocyanidins <i>in vitro</i> through a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxidation of corresponding 
/leucoanthocyanidins |CITS: [11316805]|. Assuming that the site of initial oxidation is the same for anthocyanidin 
/and dihydroflavonol formation, evidence is presented for initial oxidation at the C-3 position of the flavonoid C-ring 
/and for two bifurcating steps during catalysis by anthocyanidin synthase |CITS: [12240335]|.
/
/It is assumed that the anthocyanidin synthase proceeds via stereospecific hydroxylation at the C-3 atom of the 
/leucocyanidins which furthermore spontaneously dehydrate and finally form stable isomers, i.e. anthocyanidin 
/pseudobase (3-flaven-2,3-diol) |CITS: [DAVIES06]|.  
/
/The other enzyme of the pathway, UDPG: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-UGT) is considered as a final 
/enzyme necessary for producing the earliest stable anthocyanin molecules in plant cells |CITS: [KITAMURA06]|. 
/Glucosylation is one of the most prominent modifications of compounds involved in plant secondary metabolism 
/and often represents final steps within a pathway |CITS: [15647808]|. Flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferases catalyzing 
/red to magenta colored anthocyanins have been identified in many plant genera such as Arabidopsis |CITS: [15807784]| 
/and Gentiana |CITS: [8819318]|.
/
/<b>Regulation</b>: The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway belongs to one of the most intensely studied areas of 
/plant secondary metabolism |CITS: [11743081]| and provides probably the best-investigated regulatory system 
/in plants |CITS: [15860424]| |CITS: [QUATTROCCHIO06]|. It has long been suggested that enzymes involved in 
/the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathweay form multienzyme complexes that channel substrates towards required 
/metabolic routes and entail a complex regulation |CITS: [STAFFORD74]| |CITS: [3970546]|.
/
/Anthocyanin and proanthocyanin biosynthesis is basically regulated by transcription factors with MYB or 
/helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains and a WD40 protein. Those proteins are able to mutually interact in response to 
/the demand of the plant resulting in the activation of corresponding structural pigmentation genes |CITS: [16464150]| 
/|CITS: [15882656]| |CITS: [12586894]|. Little is known so far what regulates the regulators, but light and plant 
/hormones have been established to be central to the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes |CITS: [16464150]|.
/
/<b>Transport</b>: Anthocyanins are known to be accumulated in vacuoles where the acidic environment finally 
/causes the alteration from colorless to colored pigments. A growing body of evidence specifies that flavonoid 
/synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm indicating that a transport step is involved in the overall biosynthesis scheme 
/|CITS: [KITAMURA06]| |CITS: [16464150]|.
/
/Genes encoding glutathione S-transferases (GST's) linked to the sequestration of anthocyanins into the tonoplast 
/have been found in Petunia (AN9) |CITS: [10938372]|, carnation |CITS: [12789508]| and Arabidopsis (TT19) |CITS: [14675436]|. 
/Besides transporters that bind to certain anthocyanins and carry them to the vacuole special intravacuolar bodies, 
/i.e. anthocyanic vacuolar inclusions (AVIs) have been found to be involved in the transport and/or accumulation of anthocyanins. 
/They appear to serve as anthocyanin traps concentrating the pigments (preferentially anthocyanidin 3,5-diglycosides) 
/to a proteinaceous matrix |CITS: [11117881]|.

CITATIONS - 16107538:EV-EXP:3334595265:christ
COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate (hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate) in plant cells.  Phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth.  It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) known as phytin |CITS:[11590064],[8744268]|.  Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin |CITS:[15700415]|.  Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see |CITS:[14568069]|).  The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties.  Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract.  Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption.  Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution |CITS:[11590064],[11906835]|.  Currently, little is known of the biosynthesis of phytate.  There appears to be several routes of synthesis: a lipid-dependent route which uses Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> produced from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis by phospholipase C (see |FRAME:LIPASYN-PWY|), and a lipid-independent route relying on the phosphorylation of <i>myo</i>-inositol or Ins(3)P.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>  In this pathway, phytate is obtained from the successive phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>.  This latter compound is released from PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate) by the action of a specific phospholipase C.  The following phosphorylation steps are catalyzed by two enzymes: an Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 3-/5-/6-kinase, which in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is encoded by two genes, <i>AtIPK2&alpha;</i> and<i>AtIPK2&beta;</i>; and an inositol polyphosphate 2-kinase, encoded by  the <i>Arabidopsis AtIPK1</i> gene.  All of these proteins can catalyze the conversion of several inositol phosphates.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Heme (protoheme, heme <i>b</i>) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins
/including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. 
/In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in
/transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.
/
/Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as
/|FRAME: Heme-b|, different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in
/modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|,
/|FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.
/
/The protoheme biosynthetic pathway shown here is found in some bacteria (including
/|FRAME: TAX-83333|), archaea, and plants. In these organisms the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway
/starts with glutamate (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|).
/
/In many other organisms, including animals, fungi, apicomplexan protozoa (such as the malaria parasite
/|FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [15144063]|), and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, the tetrapyrrole
/biosynthesis pathway starts with glycine and succinyl-CoA (see |FRAME:PWY-5189|).
/Both the glycine and glutamate pathways are present in the chloroplast-containing |FRAME: TAX-3039|
/(reviewed in |CITS: [13680202], [15576047], [12051904], [16093570]|).
/
/Both tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways merge at the intermediate |FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE|.
/However, a branch point at |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| leads to biosynthesis of different
/compounds such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|),
/|FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|),
/and heme D biosynthesis.
/A second branch point at |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| leads to biosynthesis of chlorophyll
/in plants and bacteriochlorophyll in photosynthetic bacteria (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).
/In eukaryotes, heme biosynthesis spans the mitochondrial (or plastid) and cytosol compartments.
/

COMMENT - <b>General background:</b> Sulfite is generated endogenously by the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino 
/acids such as methionine and cysteine. In addition, sulfite is formed from sulfur dioxide, an environmental pollutant, 
/and is provided exogenously, either as a constituent of certain fruits, or as a preservative in dried fruits, vegetables 
/and wine |CITS: [8586770]| |CITS: [16407262]|. Sulfite in excess will cause damage to the organism, by breaking 
/disulfide bridges (sulfitolysis), forming metabolic inhibitors such as hydroxysulfonates and interfere with the availability 
/of essential cations required for nutrition |CITS: [HEBER98]|. 
/
/<b>About the pathway:</b> Sulfite oxidation is different in plants and animals. In vertebrates the role of sulfite 
/oxidation lays in the detoxification of sulfite derived from the decomposition of sulfur-containing amino acids. 
/Plants assimilate sulfur by reducing sulfate via sulfite to sulfide to form cysteine. One major point is the different 
/location of sulfite oxidase (SO). The enzyme is found in vertebrates in the mitochondria whereas the plant SO 
/has been localized to the peroxisome |CITS: [15653809]|. Sulfite oxidation constitutes a converse pathway to 
/sulfate assimilation which has been found in chloroplasts. Therefore, peroxisomal sulfite detoxification solves 
/the problem of having two counteracting pathways in the same cell compartment |CITS: [16307306]|. 
/
/In contrast to its animal counterpart SO lacks the heme domain, hence being the only known Mo enzyme that 
/possesses no other redox-active centers |CITS: [11598126]|. It has been demonstrated that the reaction 
/catalyzed by sulfite oxidase involves the conversion of molecular oxygen into hydrogen peroxide |CITS: [16407262]|.
/
/While sulfite produced during the process of sulfate assimilation is fast converted into sulfide, SO has been 
/discussed to serve as 'safety valve' to detoxify increased levels of sulfite |CITS: [16307306]| which would be 
/harmful to plants. Under such conditions (high sulfite concentration) the catalase in the peroxisomes is inhibited 
/and excess hydrogen peroxide adds sulfite oxidizing capacities in a non-enzymatically way, hence both enzymatic 
/and non-enzymatic steps are involved in the sulfite oxidation in plants |CITS: [16407262]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  L-Arabinose, the 4-epimer of D-xylose, is a monosaccharide found primarily in plants.  It is mainly present in cell wall polymers such as pectic (rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II) and hemicellulosic (xylan, xyloglucan) components, as well as in the glycosyl-moieties of proteins such as arabinogalactan proteins and extensions |CITS:[10517829],[10640355]|.  Although little is known of the incorporation of arabinose into these polymers or the contribution of the arabinosyl-substituents to the functions of the wall polymers, it has been demonstrated that arabinose-containing polymers are derived from UDP-L-arabinose, the activated sugar used by arabinosyltransferases |CITS:[FEINGOLD80]|.
/
/The formation of UDP-L-arabinose occurs via two routes: a) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-L-arabinose from free arabinose (this pathway), and b) a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route involving the epimerisation of UDP-D-xylose by a UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase (|FRAME:PWY-63|).  
/
/In plants, the primary role of the sugar salvage pathways is presumed to be in the recycling of sugars derived from the turnover of macromolecules such as polysaccharides, galactolipids and proteoglycans, which have sugar components. 
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>  Numerous bacterial, fungal, and mammalian sugar kinase genes have been isolated and have led to the identification of three evolutionarily distinct gene families: hexokinase, ribokinase and galactokinase families.  In plants, few enzymes of the galactokinase have been described: both galactokinase and arabinokinase activities have been reported in cell-free preparations from seedlings of <i>Phaseolus aureus</i> |CITS:[14426659],[165743]|; additionally, the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana ARA1</i> gene encoding an arabinose kinase (its activity was detected in crude extracts) has been cloned |CITS:[DOLEZAL91]|.  The formation of UDP-L-arabinose at the end of the salvage pathway is achieved by a UDP-L-arabinose pyrophosphorylase.  An enzyme with such activity has been purified from pea sprouts.  This enzyme (USP for 'UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase') was shown to have a broad range of monosaccharide substrates |CITS:[15326166]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/
/Sterols are isoprenoid-derived molecules that have essential functions in eukaryotes in general, and in
/higher plants in particular. In vertebrates cholesterol is by far the major sterol, whereas a mixture of
/various sterols is present in higher plants: sitosterol (usually predominant), stigmasterol, campesterol,
/isofucosterol, brassicasterol and cholesterol. Sterols are present in three forms: free sterols
/(the major form with a free 3&beta;-hydroxyl), steryl esters and steryl glucosides. Free sterols are
/integral components of the membrane lipid bilayer and thus interact with some molecular species of
/phosphoglycero(sphingo) lipids. The extent of this interaction plays a functional role in the regulation
/of membrane fluidity and permeability. Sterols have also been shown to play important roles in embryonic
/development of vertebrates and the formation of membrane microdomains (rafts), which may constitute
/signaling centers for multiple pathways |CITS:[11278759]|. Finally, sterols are precursors of compounds
/with a high physiological activity such as brassinosteroids, an important class of plant hormones involved
/in growth and development |CITS: [8602526]|, ecdysteroids in invertebrates |CITS:[7791536]| and plants
/|CITS:[CORIOT93]|, and antheridiol and oogoniols, sexual pheromones of aquatic fungi belonging to
/the saprolegniale class |CITS:[1913877]|.
/
/<b>In plants:</b>
/
/The sterol biosynthesis pathway is essentially linear until reaching 24-methylene lophenol, with a
/ bifurcation downstream of this compound that results in two main pathways leading to 24-methyl- and
/24-ethyl-sterols. The simplicity of this pathway is essentially due to i) the relatively high substrate
/specificity of most enzymes from the postsqualene segment of the biosynthetic chain and ii) to the
/ channeling of substrates/products through microdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS:[15377227]|.
/A number of minor sterols have been detected suggesting that in addition to the main sterol biosynthesis
/pathway depicted here a number of side pathways exist. Those compounds remain largely undetected
/until sterol biosynthesis inhibitors are used or genes encoding various enzymes of the biosynthesis
/pathways are mutated. Our knowledge of the sterol biosynthesis pathway in plants results largely from
/the study of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants and through detecting the accumulated intermediates
/and/or functional complementation of the mutant phenotypes with wild type genes.
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>
/
/i) Of the many enzymes involved in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, very few have been purified to
/homogeneity. Nonetheless many genes encoding those proteins have been cloned in
/|FRAME:TAX-3701 <i>Arabidopsis</i>| and have been expressed in heterologous systems where the substrate specificity
/of the corresponding enzymes has been assessed (see individual comments on particular enzymes). 
/
/ii) One of the major rate-limiting steps of this pathway is the C-24 methylation of cycloartenol catalyzed
/by sterol methyltransferases 1 (SMT1).
/
/ iii) The obtusifoliol 14&alpha;-demethylase OBT14DM (CYP51)
/from |FRAME:TAX-4577 <i>Zea mays</i>| (corn) has been described as a major potential herbicide target.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Leucoanthocyanidins such as leucopelargonidin and leucocyanidin are colorless 
/intermediates in the biosynthetic course to build up the corresponding colored anthocyanins (|FRAME:PWY-5125|) 
/|CITS: [12828368]|. Leucoanthocyanidins are compounds at a branch-point embedded in that metabolic sequence. 
/They either can be oxidized to form anthocyanins or can be reduced to serve as precursors for catechins and 
/proanthocyanins (|FRAME:PWY-641|) |CITS: [12435592]| |CITS: [15720617]|. As such leucoanthocyanidins 
/represent an important regulatory point to feed a range of flavonoid subclasses of diverse biological properties 
/|CITS: [11402179]|.
/
/Flavonoids are extensively modified by a number of reactions such as hydroxylation, methylation, glycosylation 
/and acylation. The hydroxylation of the flavonoid B-ring at the 3',4' or 5' position leads to a variety of flavonoids 
/contributing to different colors of flowers and seeds |CITS: [11287230]|. The monohydroxylated leucopelargonidin 
/and the dihydroxylated leucocyanidin give rise to anthocyanins adding red/pink colors to a broad variety of plants, 
/including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [10504566]| |CITS: [10536025]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Leucopelargonidin and leucocyanidin derive from dihydrokaempferol and dihydroquercetin, 
/respectively which, in turn are either formed by a Fe<sup>2+</sup>/oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of 
/naringenin to generate dihydrokaempferol and eriodictyol to make dihydroquercetin |CITS: [8223617]| |CITS: [8685272]| 
/or a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (flavonoid 3'hydroxylase) which hydroxylates dihydrokaempferol 
/to form dihydroquercetin |CITS: [11030432]|.
/
/The discernible step in the biosynthetic route towards leucoanthocyanidins is the stereospecific reduction of 
/(2R,3R)-dihydroflavonols carried out by dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. The enzyme exhibits a pronounced substrate 
/specificity which determines a visible pattern of anthocyanins, catechins and proanthocyanidins indicative for 
/certain species |CITS: [12435592]|. 
/
/The lack of the B-ring modifying enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase catalyzing the formation of 3',4',5'-pentahydroxylated 
/compounds and derivatives thereof (e.g. dihydromyricetin) in Arabidopsis |CITS: [10536025]| prevents the 
/biosynthesis of the glucosylated anthocyanidins delphinidin, petunidin and malvidin, contributing to the blue/violet 
/colors in plants.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Bacterial membranes typically consist of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL "phosphatidylglycerol"|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE "phosphatidylethanolamine"| and |FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN "cardiolipin"|. These anionic phospholipids are important for membrane biogenesis and function.
/
/The plant pathogen |FRAME: TAX-340| has been shown to synthesize |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE "phosphatidylcholine"| using a yeast-like acylation pathway |CITS: 24329598| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-7470|). The presence of a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase in this organism (UniProt ID Q4UWE4) suggests that a typically bacterial |FRAME: PWY-5669| pathway is also present.
/
/However, analysis of a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase mutant suggested that an additional, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase-independent and |FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|-dependent route of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE "phosphatidylethanolamine"| biosynthesis was also present in this organism. They characterized a bifunctional cardiolipin/phosphatidylethanolamine synthase that also synthesizes |FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN "cardiolipin"| in a typically eukaryotic manner via this bifunctional enzyme |CITS: [24707916]| (this pathway).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/A bifunctional cardiolipin/phosphatidylethanolamine synthase has been characterized in the plant pathogen |FRAME: TAX-314565| that provides an additional |FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|-dependent, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase-independent, route for |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE "phosphatidylethanolamine"| biosynthesis. In addition, the cardiolipin synthase activity of this enzyme is more typical of those found in eukarytoes, although such a cardiolipin synthase has also been described in actinobacteria |CITS: 19439403| (see |FRAME: AT4G04870-MONOMER|).

CITATIONS - PMNUPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The primary nitrogen assimilation routes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and prokaryotes are nitrogen fixation, nitrate assimilation, and ammonia assimilation.
/Ammonia is liberated by photorespiration, protein and amino acid metabolism, and the breakdown of nitrogen transport compounds. The rate of ammonia generation during photorespiration is about 10 times the rate of nitrate assimilation.
/
/The ammonia released from photorespiration is immediately re-assimilated via the ammonia assimilation cycle. The net result of this cycle is the conversion of one molecule of ammonia to one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one ATP molecule.
/
/The pathway includes two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-4585 "glutamine synthetase"| (GS) and |FRAME: MONOMER-7421 "glutamate synthase"| (also known as <b>g</b>lutamine <b>o</b>xo<b>g</b>lutarate <b>a</b>mino<b>t</b>ansferase or GOGAT), and thus is often referred to as the GS/GOGAT pathway. Two types of GOGAT are known in photosynthetic organisms - NADH-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent. NADH-GOGAT is found in the nucleus of vascular plants, fungi, and diatoms. The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is only found in Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes. Plants possess both enzymes.
/
/An NADPH-dependent version of GOGAT is found in non-photosynthetic bacteria and archaea (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).

COMMENT - The purine degradation pathway plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in most organisms.
/The final product of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthesis, |FRAME:IMP|, is degraded through
/sequential enzymatic steps into |FRAME: URATE|, which contains a high level of nitrogen
/|CITS: [11891236]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5044|).
/In most organisms, including some bacteria, plants, and certain animals, |FRAME: URATE| is metabolized
/via a common pathway, producing the stereospecific form |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| as the final product
/|CITS: [16317038]|. Some organisms that are not able to degrade urate include humans, apes, birds and
/reptiles |CITS: [16462750]|.
/
/It has previously been thought that |FRAME: ALLANTOIN| is formed from |FRAME: URATE| in a single
/step, catalyzed by |FRAME:ENZRXN-14266|. However, it is now established that the process involves
/three different enzymes |CITS: [16462750]|. In the first step of the pathway |FRAME: MONOMER-3146|
/catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: URATE| to |FRAME: 5-HYDROXYISOURATE| |CITS: [Modric92]
/[Kahn97]|. |FRAME: 5-HYDROXYISOURATE| is relatively unstable, and indeed decomposes <i>in
/vitro</i> to yield allantoin. However, this spontaneous reaction is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, because
/spontaneous decomposition yields racemic |FRAME: ALLANTOIN|, while organisms contain mostly the |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| enantiomer.
/
/An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N1-C6 bond of |FRAME: 5-HYDROXYISOURATE|,
/forming |FRAME: CPD-5821|, has been discovered and isolated from |FRAME: TAX-3847|
/|CITS: [10567345]|. An enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of |FRAME: CPD-5821| to
/|FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN| was first discovered in mouse |CITS: [16462750]| and later purified from
/|FRAME: ORG-5993||CITS: [20167108][20511299]| and |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [17567580]|.
/
/This pathway is part of various metaboilc processes, including both degradative pathways, such as
/the degradation of purines to glyoxylate and urea or ammonia, and biosynthetic pathways, such as the plant
/biosynthesis of ureides, which is part of the mechanism used by tropical legumes to trasport the nitrogen
/fixed by their bacterial symbionts in the root nodules to the rest of the plant (see |FRAME: URSIN-PWY|).

COMMENT - In higher plants, the primary seed storage reserve is triacylglycerol. During seed germination, triacylglycerol is broken 
/down to fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are converted to sucrose via glyoxylate cycle to support seedling growth. 
/Radio tracer experiments have also demonstrated that glycerol can be converted to sucrose as well. The contribution 
/of carbon stored as glycerol is relatively small, being estimated of 5% of the total carbon. Two possible routes of 
/glycerol catabolism have been proposed. In the first pathway, glycerol is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate by 
/glycerol kinase, and then converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In the 
/second pathway, glycerol is coverted to dihydroxyacetone by NAD-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase, and then 
/phosphorylated to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by dihydroxyacetone kinase. The assertion of the first pathway, not 
/the second pathway, in plants is supported by the following evidence: glycerol kinase and glycerol-3-phosphate 
/dehydrogenase activities are detected in germinating seeds, whereas NAD-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase activity 
/is not; the highest expression of the glycerol kinase and the FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
/genes are detected during seed germination; the glycerol kinase mutant, gli1, of Arabidopsis is disrupted in glycerol 
/catabolism and accumulates glycerol. It is worth noting that, in addition to the mitochondrial FAD-dependent 
/glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, plants also have cytosolic and plastidial NAD-dependent 
/glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that can convert glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. But 
/the NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is unlikely to be involved in glycerol degradation since the 
/equilibrium constant favors the synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate. The product of glycerol degradation, 
/dihydroxyacetone phosphate, can be converted to sugars via gluconeogenesis.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| is a  non-standard amino acid that is not normally incorporated into proteins
/during protein synthesis.
/The name citrulline was coined in 1930 from |FRAME:TAX-3653|, the Latin name of the watermelon, from which it was
/first isolated.
/Free citrulline is formed mainly by catabolism of amino acids in the small intestine (see
/|FRAME:CITRULBIO-PWY|), as an intermediate in the conversion of ammonia to urea in the
/|FRAME:PWY-4984|, and as a by-product during the production of nitric oxide (see
/|FRAME:PWY-4983|).
/In addition, citrulline is also formed by modification of arginine residues in proteins (see
/|FRAME: PWY-4921|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Free citrulline metabolism involves three key enzymes: nitric oxide synthase (NOS, EC 1.14.13.39), which catalyzes
/the production of nitric oxide from arginine, generating citrulline as a by-product, |FRAME:CPLX-6662|
/(OCT, EC 2.1.3.3), which produces citrulline by condensing carbamoyl phosphate and L-ornithine,
/and |FRAME: CPLX-6641| (ASS, EC 6.3.4.5), which converts citrulline into argininosuccinate.
/
/The tissue distribution of these enzymes results in three orthogonal metabolic routes for citrulline in
/mammals, all of which are depicted in this pathway:
/
/1. In the liver, citrulline is locally synthesized by the combined action of |FRAME:CPLX-6621|,
/|FRAME: HS00415-MONOMER| and |FRAME:CPLX-6662|, and
/metabolized by |FRAME: CPLX-6641| and |FRAME:CPLX-6661| back to arginine.
/The main purpose of this cycle is the production of urea, and it is described in greater detail in the pathway
/|FRAME:PWY-4984|. 
/
/2. In most of the tissues producing NO, citrulline is generated from arginine in a single step by NOS,
/and then recycled back into arginine via |FRAME: CPLX-6641| and |FRAME:CPLX-6661|.
/The main purpose of this cycle is the production of NO, and it is described in greater detail in the
/pathway |FRAME:PWY-4983|. 
/
/3. In the gut citrulline is synthesized from glutamine and other amino acids (such as proline) by the
/combined action of many enzymes, including
/|FRAME:CPLX-6761|, |FRAME: HS00730-MONOMER|, |FRAME: HS01958-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME:CPLX-6747| and |FRAME:CPLX-6662|.
/Citrulline is then released into the blood, and converted back into arginine in the kidneys by
/|FRAME: CPLX-6641| and |FRAME:CPLX-6661|.
/The main purpose of this pathway is the transport of arginine in the blood, avoiding captation by the liver,
/and it is described in the pathway |FRAME:CITRULBIO-PWY|.
/
/Citrulline has long been administered in the treatment of inherited urea cycle disorders, and recent studies
/suggest that it may be used to control the production of NO.
/
/In plants, citrulline has additional roles. It has been shown that in
/drought-tolerant wild watermelon leaves citrulline functions both as a compatible solute and ahydroxyl
/radical scavenger |CITS: [11728468][12102508]|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales, 
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family. 
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many 
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard.
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan 
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on 
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different glucosinolates, 
/of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine (range from homomethionine 
/to hexahomomethionine) (compare |FRAME:PWYQT-4450 aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, side chain elongation cycle|). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among 
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| is a secondary messenger molecule used in signal transduction and lipid signaling in eukaryotic cells.
/It mediates the biological response of a large number of hormones and neurotransmitters in target cells by regulating calcium release from intracellular stores.

/
/Once formed, the levels of |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| are tightly regulated by two mechanisms.
/

COMMENT - Phosphatidylcholine is one of the major constituents of membrane phospholipids (see |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN2-PWY|). 
/The phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathways vary among different organisms. 
/
/There are at least four alternative routes have been reported in plants. Two additional routes were 
/reported in animals|CITS: [438165]| and bacteria|CITS: [10858449]|.
/
/1) The Kennedy pathway (|FRAME: PWY3O-450|) depends on choline kinase and on the availability of choline. 
/
/2) The second pathway (depicted here) depends on three consecutive N-methylation steps that are 
/carried out on phospho-bases, phosphoethanolamine, phospho-N-methylethanolamine, and 
/phospho-N-dimethylethanolamine. 
/
/3) The third pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-3|) depends on an initial N-methylation with phospho-base 
/phosphoethanolamine, and followed by two downstream N-methylations on phosphatidyl-bases, 
/phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine. In plants, 
/phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine is believed to be derived from CDP-methylethanolamine, 
/whereas in animals, it is a direct methylation product from phosphatidylethanolamine|CITS: [438165]|. 
/
/4) The forth pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-4|) depends on two N-methylations with phospho-base 
/phosphoethanolamine and phospho-N-methylethanolamine, followed by a downstream 
/N-methylation on phosphatidyl-base phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine.
/
/Radio tracer experiments with crude cell extracts suggested such a pathway in Lemna and 
/carrot|CITS: [16666464]|, but not in soybean. An Arabidopsis gene (AtNMT1) was isolated through 
/functional complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in phosphatidylcholine. Assay of the AtNMT1 
/recombinant enzyme indicated that it catalyzes three sequential methylations of phosphoethanolamine 
/to form phosphocholine|CITS: [11115895]|.

CITATIONS - 16669783:EV-EXP-IDA:3402243334:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleotides represent fundamental compounds central to both primary metabolism
/and many aspects of secondary plant metabolism. Involved in many cellular processes, pyrimidines are
/considered of vital importance for growth, development and reproduction |CITS: [16669783][9576794]|.
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides gives rise to |FRAME: UMP uridine-5'-phosphate| (UMP)
/from which all other pyrimidines within the cell are derived. Further phosphotransfer and nucleotide
/modification reactions (illustrated in this pathway) convert the monophosphate to diphosphate and triphosphate
/nucleotides.
/|FRAME: UDP UDP| is of special importance as it serves as a glycosyl carrier in a plethora of reactions involved in many
/primary and secondary metabolism pathways.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism enclosing phosphotransfer and nucleotide modification routes
/appears to connect to a network of interacting metabolic pathways involved in growth and development
/which is not well understood |CITS: [15561724]|.
/
/The first enzyme of the pathway, |FRAME: UMPKI-CPLX uridylate kinase|, catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP.
/The enzyme from plants catalyzes both the formation of UDP and CDP from their corresponding monophosphates,
/and was thus named |FRAME: AT5G26667-MONOMER UMP/CMP kinase| |CITS: [15604701]|.
/The conserved glycine-rich sequence GGPG(S/A)GK, a hallmark for all eukaryotic monophosphokinases
/|CITS: [17143579]|, has been found of significant importance for ATP binding and enzyme catalysis |CITS: [1303803]|.
/
/The next enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX nucleoside diphosphate kinase| (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the
/terminal phosphate of a nucleoside-triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside-diphosphate - in this case, the
/transfer of a phosphate from ATP to UDP, forming UTP.
/The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates,
/including formation of CTP from CDP.
/In Arabidopsis thaliana the enzyme is encoded by a small gene family and has been demonstrated to mediate
/polar auxin transport in plants |CITS: [15927941]| and interact with other proteins conferring stress tolerance
/|CITS: [12506203]|.
/
/Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleosides is made possible by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependnet
/enzyme |FRAME: CTPSYN-CPLX CTP synthetase|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Phospholipids are the major structural components of biological membranes. Some phospholipids 
/(i.e. phosphatidylinositol) also serve as important lipid-signaling molecules.  In plants, phospholipids 
/predominate extra-chloroplast membranes including the plasma membrane, mitochondria membrane, 
/endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomal membrane, with phosphatidylcholine and 
/phosphatidylethanolamine being the major constituents. On the other hand, glycolipids predominate 
/chloroplast envolope and thylakoid membranes. Phosphatidylglycerol is the only phospholipid found in 
/chloroplast thylakoids, and is critical for the structural and functional integrity of the thylakoid 
/membranes. 
/
/Phospholipids are mostly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once synthesized, 
/they are transported to other phospholipid containing membranes. However, genetic and biochemical evidence has 
/demonstrated that phosphatidylglycerol can be synthesized in the plastids |CITS: [16774646]|. In addition, 
/mitochondria also contain enzymes for phospholipid synthesis, thus we cannot rule out the possibility 
/that phospholipids can be synthesized there.

/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  
/
/An important branch-point in the biosynthesis of carotenoids lies in the cyclization of the linear, pink
/|FRAME:CPD1F-114| into carotenes with all-&beta;-, all-&epsilon;- or mixed &beta; and &epsilon; rings.
/The cyclization reactions are catalyzed by lycopene &beta;- or &epsilon;-cyclases.
/These cyclases all share a conserved amino acid sequence signature and bind dinucleotides such as
/FAD and NADP |CITS:[8837512]|, but otherwise share little resemblance.
/A single cyclization performed by a |FRAME: MONOMER-12154| adds a &beta; ring at one end,
/resulting in |FRAME: CPD1F-126|. A second cyclization at the other end produces |FRAME: CPD1F-129|.

/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes.

/
/|FRAME:SPERMINE| is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed spermine synthase.  The propylamine group is transferred from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.  The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Phosphatidylcholine is one of the major constituents of membrane phospholipids in eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN2-PWY|).  It is also present in the membranes of some bacteria. The phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathways vary among different organisms. 
/
/At least four alternative routes have been reported in plants (see 1-4 below, |CITS: [16666397][16666464][11115895][7998981][15147879]|). Additional routes were reported in animals and yeast (see 1 and 5 below, |CITS: [438165][16246068]| and reviewed in |CITS: [18204095][17010666]|) and bacteria (see 1, 5, 6 and 7 below, |CITS: [10858449][14756787]| and reviewed in |CITS: [14663079][20656373]|).
/
/1) The first pathway (|FRAME: PWY3O-450|) is a branch of the Kennedy pathway for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (|FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE|) and phosphatidylcholine (|FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|) in eukaryotes (reviewed in |CITS: [20503434]|) (see also |FRAME: PWY4FS-6|).  In addition, this pathway has been identified in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-158| |CITS: [14756787]|.
/
/2) The second pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-2|) depends on three consecutive <i>N</i>-methylation steps that are carried out on phospho-bases, phosphoethanolamine, phospho-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine, and phospho-<i>N</i>-dimethylethanolamine. 
/
/3) The third pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-3|) depends on an initial <i>N</i>-methylation with phospho-base phosphoethanolamine, and followed by two downstream <i>N</i>-methylations on phosphatidyl-bases, phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-dimethylethanolamine. In plants, phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine is believed to be derived from CDP-methylethanolamine, whereas in animals, it is a direct methylation product from phosphatidylethanolamine |CITS: [438165]|. 
/
/4) The fourth pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-4|) depends on two <i>N</i>-methylations with phospho-base phosphoethanolamine and phospho-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine, followed by a downstream <i>N</i>-methylation on phosphatidyl-base phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-dimethylethanolamine.
/
/5) The fifth pathway (depicted here) depends on the direct conversion of the phosphatidyl-base phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine by successive methylations.
/
/6) The sixth pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6826|) involves a one-step direct condensation of |FRAME: CHOLINE| with CDP-diacylglycerol to form phosphatidylcholine by the bacterial enzyme phosphatidylcholine synthase (EC 2.7.8.24).
/
/7) The seventh pathway (|FRAME: PWY-7470|) involves bacterial |FRAME: ACYL-COA "acyl-CoA"|-dependent acyltransferases that catalyze the two-step acylation of |FRAME: L-1-GLYCERO-PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE| to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE| |CITS: [24329598]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway is found in animals, yeast, and bacteria that interact with eukaryotic cells (reviewed in |CITS: [18204095][17010666][20656373]|). In the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| this is the primary pathway, but both this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY3O-450| can substiture for one another depending on growth conditions.  The two pathways offer versatility in regulation of the molecular species composition of phosphatidylcholine in yeast |CITS: [12627972][15258140]| (in |CITS: [2198947]| and reviewed in |CITS: [17010666]|).
/
/Among bacteria, both this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6826| are present in |FRAME: TAX-358| and |FRAME: TAX-382|.  The pathway shown here is the only pathway identified in |FRAME: TAX-542|.  It is the preferred pathway in |FRAME: TAX-375|, |FRAME: TAX-312252| and |FRAME: TAX-1063|.  In |FRAME: TAX-235| this pathway may function under certain conditions |CITS: [16882035]|, in |FRAME: TAX-446| it appears to be a minor pathway |CITS: [17979985]| and in |FRAME: TAX-287| this pathway may be nonfunctional |CITS: [12169604]| (reviewed in |CITS: [20656373][12848422][14663079]|).

COMMENT - Phospholipids are important membrane components. Most of the phospholipids belong to the category of phosphoglycerides. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as phosphatidates, are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group. The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on carbon-1 and carbon-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to carbon-3 by an ester link. Phosphatidates are precursors for many phosphoglycerides found in animals, plants and yeast, including |FRAME: Phosphatidylinositols|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-SERINE|, |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CARDIOLIPIN|.
/
/As part of the synthesis of these phosphoglycerides, either the phosphatidate or the modifying compound need to be activated by |FRAME:CTP|. In some cases, the modifying compound is activated, as in the case of |FRAME: CHOLINE| and |FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|, which form |FRAME: CDP-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: CDP-ETHANOLAMINE|, respectively. However, in the case of other compounds, such as |FRAME: SER| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, the phosphatidate is activated first, forming |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|, which then reacts with the modifying compound to form the phosphoglyceride.
/
/In plants, this pathway is found in the cytosol. A variant pathway, |FRAME: PWY0-1319| operates in the plastid and provides the primary source of phosphatidyl glycerol in the plastids.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The alternative terminal oxidase pathway is found in the mitochondrial respiratory chain of plants (also known as the electron transport chain, or ETC), as well as some fungi and protists |CITS:[9349280],[9426242],[12228600],[10981696],[11405094]|, but is absent from animal mitochondria.  Unlike the cytochrome respiratory pathway, the alternative pathway is not coupled to synthesis of ATP and is not inhibited by cyanide. It is however inhibited by substituted hydroxamic acids such as |FRAME:CPD-6543| (SHAM) and |FRAME:CPD-6542|.  Alternative oxidase (AOX) activity was first described as oxygen consumption in the presence of cyanide from the study of lily pollen and was later found in high levels in the thermogenic inflorescences of the unusual group of plants belonging to the family Araceae.  In this family AOX allows rapid, uncoupled respiration, leading to a characteristic heating of the inflorescence |CITS:[MEEUSE75]|. This process, also known as thermogenesis, uses the heat produced during flowering to volatize a compound that attracts pollinating insects. In other, more typical plant species, AOX activity has been proposed to be involved in response to oxidative stress |CITS:[Moller01]|.  There, AOX would be used to minimize the formation of reactive oxygen species by preventing the overreduction of the ETC. The pathway has drawn special interest as a target for anti-parasite therapeutics since it was shown to play a key role in the respiration of the trypanosome, better known as the causative agent of African sleeping sickness |CITS:[7581322]|.  The alternative pathway branches from the cytochrome pathway in the inner mitochondrial membrane at the ubiquinone pool and passes electrons to a single terminal oxidase, the alternative oxidase.  This protein reduces molecular oxygen to water in a single four-electron transfer step.  The electron transport through the alternative oxidase from ubiquinone to water does not contribute to the transmembrane potential and wastes two of the three coupling sites that are part of the cytochrome pathway.  Some energy production is nevertheless achieved through the phosphorylating potential of NADH dehydrogenase (|FRAME:CPLX-5263|) |CITS:[15012279]|.

COMMENT - Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) catalyze the oxidative cleavage of C-C double-bonds in carotenoids forming apocarotenoids |CITS: [16616608], [20670614]|. Apocarotenoids is a diverse class of compounds that play important physiological roles. For example, vitamin A (retinol and retinal) is required for vision in animals, abscisic acid is required for seed development in plants, and many small volatile aroma compounds such as beta-ionone give the characteristic of fruits and flowers. 
/
/Some CCDs recognize specific carotenoid substrates, whereas others act upon a broad range of substrates. Some cleave specific double bonds while others can cleave double bonds at different positions. So far the best characterized plant CCDs include CCD1, CCD4, CCD7, CCD8, ZCD and LCD.
/
/CCD1 and CCD4 have been isolated from a number of plant species |CITS: [11316814], [19264332], [15584954], [19120446], [18611853]|. They generally show promiscuity in choice of substrates. For example, the rice CCD1, like the Arabidopsis CCD1, cleaves both linear and cyclic carotenoids at the 9,10 and 9',10' positions. 
/In addition, the rice CCD1 also cleaves 5',6' and 7',8' double bonds in combination with cleavage at the 9,10 double bond |CITS: [19120446]|. The Arabidopsis CCD7 catalyzes a specific asymmetric 9,10-cleavage of beta-carotene to produce beta-ionone (C13) and 10'-apo-beta-carotenal (C27) |CITS: [15342640]|. 10'-apo-beta-carotenal is further cleaved by CCD8 |CITS: [15342640]|. ZCD from Crocus sativus is a zeaxanthin-specific CCD that cleaves 7,8(7',8') double bonds |CITS: [12509521]|. LCD from Bixa orellana is a lycopene-specific CCD that recognizes 5,6(5',6') double bonds |CITS: [12829782]|.
/
/Besides CCDs, Nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) is another enzyme class that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids. They specifically cleave the 11,12(11',12') double bond of 9-cis-violaxanthin or 9-cis-neoxanthin which leads to the |FRAME: PWY-695 "synthesis of abscisic acid"| in plants |CITS: [11532178]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Phylloquinone (vitamin K1, 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) acts as the electron 
/transfer cofactor A1 of photosystem I (PS I) in higher plants and cyanobacteria. In non-photosynthetic
/microbes the very similar compound |FRAME: Menaquinones| plays an
/essential role in several anaerobic electron transport systems |CITS: [8626063]|.
/The chemical structure of menaquinone (vitamin K2)  exhibits a partly unsaturated side chain consisting
/most often 7 prenyl units, whereas phylloquinone consists of a mostly saturated phytyl side chain of
/4 units |CITS: [15686525]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of phylloquinone was studied in detail in the cyanobacterium |FRAME: TAX-1148| and
/the genes encoding enzymes of this pathway were identified by comparison with genes encoding
/enzymes of the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway in |FRAME:TAX-562|
/(see |FRAME:MENAQUINONESYN-PWY|) |CITS: [8626063]|. With the isolation and functional
/confirmation of the homolog genes in |FRAME:TAX-1142| encoding for |FRAME: MONOMER-13822|,
/|FRAME: MONOMER-13896| |CITS: [10722690]|, |FRAME: MONOMER-13821|
/|CITS:[11772039]|, |FRAME: MONOMER-13897| and |FRAME: MONOMER-11678| |CITS: [JOHNSON03]|,
/most of the enzymatic steps of the phylloquinone bisoynthesis have been determined and proven to be highly
/identical with those in the menaquinone biosynthesis.
/
/The biosynthesis of certain components of the multienzyme complex PS I (such as phylloquinone)
/in cyanobacteria and plants have been found to follow analogous routes, including corresponding
/enzymatic activities |CITS: [HEIDE82]| |CITS: [KOLKMANN87][SIMANTIRAS89][SIMANTIRAS91]|,
/reflecting the phylogenetic origin of PS I in photosynthetic microbes.  
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzymatic steps involved in the biosynthesis of phylloquinone in cyanobacteria and plants are almost
/identical to the biosynthetic route leading to the microbial complement menaquinone.
/The discernible step between phylloquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis is the prenylation of
/|FRAME: DIHYDROXYNAPHTHOATE| (DHNA).
/The DHNA phytyltransferase catalyzes the attachment of a C-20 phytyl side chain leading to
/|FRAME:CPD-6947| |CITS: [15686525]|, whereas microbial DHNA prenyltransferases attache a
/multiprenyl side chain, forming  demethylmenaquinones. The length of the side chain varies among
/different species.
/
/It has been found that phylloquinone is not absolutely required for efficient electron transfer in PS I
/|CITS: [10722690]|. At least in |FRAME: TAX-1148|, benzoquinones such as
/|FRAME:PLASTOQUINONE-9|, which usually act as secondary electron acceptors in PS II
/|CITS: [11470786][15681848]|, can efficiently replace phylloquinone in the A1-site of PS I as a
/one-electron cofactor. However, as shown in both |FRAME:TAX-3701| and |FRAME: TAX-1148| mutants,
/the deficiency of phylloquinone causes distortions in the thylakoid structure of chloroplasts,
/decreases the content of PS I, and affects the functionality of PS II |CITS: [15686525]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-6481 Eugenol| and |FRAME: ISOEUGENOL| are scent volatiles of the phenylpropene type emitted by plants as attractants and in defense response. The phenylpropenes have a phenyl ring with a propenyl side chain derived from coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol, which are precursors of the |FRAME: PWY-361| |CITS: [17912370]|. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-6481 Eugenol| has been in the forefront of the spice trade since ancient times, the food-preserving and analgesic properties of eugenol-rich clove has led to discoveries of new nations and trade routes. The characteristic 
/scent of basil (|FRAME: TAX-39350|) plant is due to the volatile |FRAME: CPD-6481|, produced by the enzyme eugenol synthase |CITS: [17912370]|. The antimicrobial properties of neutrophils are shown to be inhibited by |FRAME: CPD-6481| |CITS: [18215676]|.
/
/Different plants emit them in combinations of varying amounts which imparts the distinctive aromas of flowers, in |FRAME: TAX-36903| the flowers emit an equal mixture of |FRAME: CPD-6481| and |FRAME: ISOEUGENOL| giving them strong scents |CITS: [18208524]| and in |FRAME: TAX-4102| the flowers emit more |FRAME: ISOEUGENOL| and smaller amounts of |FRAME: CPD-6481| that imparts an odor similar to freshly cut herbs. The emission of these scent volatiles follows an diurnal rhythm in |FRAME: TAX-4102| reaching its maximal emission output around midnight |CITS: [17241449]|.

COMMENT - Fatty acids constitute a major component of plant membranes in the form of glycerolipids, mainly 
/phosphoglycerolipids and glycosylglycerolipids. The majority of them have C16 or C18 carbon chains 
/and are attached to the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. In Arabidopsis, the major fatty 
/acids are C16:0, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3. Unsaturated fatty acids are significant 
/to membrane functions such as photosynthesis and cold tolerance. C16:3 and C18:3 together make up 
/more than 90% of the fatty acid content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a major 
/glycosylglycerolipid of leaf chloroplast membranes |CITS: [arabidopsis94]|.   
/
/C18:1 is desaturated from C18:0 in the form of stearoyl-ACP (|FRAME: PWY-5147|) and is subsequently 
/incorporated into glycerolipids. The rest of the unsaturated fatty acids, C16:1, C16:2, C16:3, C18:2 and 
/C18:3, on the other hand, are desaturated from C16:0 or C18:1 after C16:0 and C18:1 are incorporated 
/into glycerolipids. These latter desaturation processes are catalyzed by membrane-bound fatty acid 
/desaturases, and occur in chloroplasts and ER. Fatty acid desaturation is best studied in Arabidopsis 
/using desaturase mutants. 
/
/The depicted glycosylglyceride desaturation pathway illustrates the biosynthesis of 18:3-16:3-MGDG 
/and 18:3-18:3-DGDG, the two most abundant glycosylglycerolipid found in chloroplast membranes. It is 
/noteworthy that desaturation occurs on both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains, and that the order of the 
/desaturation steps on one chain versus the other is not known. Here, all the possible steps are presented.

COMMENT - Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP inosine-5'-phosphate| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC adenylo-succinate| , which is converted to AMP by the action of
/|FRAME: ASL-MONOMER adenylosuccinate lyase| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126 adenosine nucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis|). Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE adenine| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE adenine|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY adenosine nucleotides degradation II|).
/
/The pathway described here is found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In it the purine nucleoside is first hydrolyzed to ribose and an adenine base by nucleoside hydrolases. The bases are then converted to the mononucleotide form |FRAME: AMP AMP| by |FRAME: MONOMER-11781 adenine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|, which utilizes |FRAME: PRPP 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate|.
/
/The pathway has been described in both prokaryotes |CITS:[4328693][11027694]| and green plants |CITS: [861230][GURANOWSKI79][12010467]|.
/
/Other routes from |FRAME: ADENOSINE adenosine| to |FRAME: AMP AMP| are described in |FRAME: P121-PWY adenine and adenosine salvage I| and |FRAME: PWY-6619 adenine and adenosine salvage VI|.

/Omega fatty acids are hypothesized to play a role in cell signaling processes. They also present an alternate route for fatty acid metabolism. Mammalian omega hydroxylases such as the ones in rat and humans have shown to be responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to its omega hydroxy derivatives reviewed here |CITS: [11513330 ]|. 
/
/Fatty acid monooxygenases found in tubers were speculated to play a part in plant defense, as they form suberin. Their role in suberization during wound healing in tubers was demonstrated in studies conducted in 1978 |CITS: [16662431]|, |CITS: [710415]|. Subsequently omega fatty acid hydroxylases have been demonstrated to play a role in plant defense in the model plant Arabidopsis |CITS: [17868380]|.
/|FRAME: TAX-3908| seedlings hydroxylate |FRAME: CPD-12299| exclusively at the methyl terminus, and this has helped in the development of an experimental system to study the stereochemistry and regioselectivity of fatty acid hydroxylases. A single cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme from |FRAME: TAX-3908| microsomes is able to form |FRAME: CPD-12282|, in-chain unsaturated analogs, and to epoxygenate 11-dodecenoic acid |CITS: [1543735]|. 11-Dodecynoic acid is a potent and specific inactivator of |FRAME: TAX-3908| |CITS: [3341756]| and |FRAME: TAX-4233| lauric &omega;-hydroxylases |CITS: [6742847]|.

/
/The bifunctional 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFK/FBPases) catalyze both the synthesis and degradation of |FRAME: CPD-535| due to two independent catalytic domains in a single polypeptide chain.

It increases flux through |FRAME: PWY66-399| which increases the isomerization of |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| to |FRAME: D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate|.

COMMENT - <B>General Background</B>
/
/Sphingolipids are ubiquitous cell components present in eukaryotes and bacteria. A sphingolipid molecule is typically composed of a long-chain base (LCB, also known as sphingoid base), an amide linked fatty acyl chain, and a polar head. Ceramides (without a polar head group), glycosylceramides, and glycosylinositolphosphoceramides (GIPCs) are the predominant plant sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin, with phosphocholine as the polar head group, is the major sphingolipid in animals. Yeast contains predominantly inositolphosphoceramides (reviewed in |CITS: [Lynch04], [20028469]|.
/
/Some physiological roles of sphingolipids have been determined. Ceramides have been well known as inducers of programmed cell death in animal cells, and the same role was evidenced in plants (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). In plants, GIPCs are involved in maintaining Golgi and ER integrity, in symbiosis, and function as GPI anchors for proteins (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). Glycosylsphingolipids play roles in increasing plasma membrane stability, reducing ion permeability and pathogenesis. They were also implicated in chilling and freezing tolerance, as well as drought tolerance in plants (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). Free LCBs (sphingoids) and phosphorylated LCBs (LCB-Ps, sphingoid 1-phosphates) were implicated as mediators of cellular responses.  Like ceramides, LCBs were shown to promote programmed cell death in mammalian and plant cells. LCB-Ps were shown to be signaling intermediates in various cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization (reviewed in |CITS: [20028469]|). 
/
/
/<B>About This Pathway</B>
/
/Ceramides are degraded by ceramidases. Ceramidases hydrolyze the N-acyl linkage between the long chain bases and the fatty acyl moieties. Ceramidases have been well characterized from human, yeast and a number of other organisms. The only characterized plant ceramidase is a rice ceramidase which however did not act with any of the predominant plant ceramides in vitro |CITS: [18547394]|. Expressing the rice ceramidase in a yeast mutant increased the yeast endogenous phytoceramide level, which indicated a reverse ceramidase activity of the rice enzyme. The in planta role of this plant ceramidase is unclear.  Free long chain bases liberated from ceramides are further degraded into corresponding aldehydes and a phosphorylethanolamine via the intermediate long chain base 1-phosphates.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Photosynthesis is a process in which energy from sunlight is harvested and used to fix
/|FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE| into carbohydrates.
/Photosynthesis occurrs in bacteria, algae, phytoplankton and higher plants.
/During photosynthesis the solar energy is trapped by light-harvesting complexes, and used to split a
/donor molecule, generating high potential electrons that are channeled to NADP<sup>+</sup>, forming NADPH,
/which can be used to reduce |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.
/
/In oxygenic photosynthesis the donor molecule is water, resulting in the release of molecular
/|FRAME:OXYGEN-MOLECULE|. Some bacteria perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, in which
/different donnor molecule are used for production of high potential electrons. An example are
/phototrophic sufur bacteria, which use sulfide, releasing molecular sulfur as a by-product.
/
/Photosynthesis is divided into two general subprocesses: the "light reactions" and the "dark reactions".
/The light reactions comprise the trapping of sunlight, the production of |FRAME:NADPH|
/and ATP, and the release of molecular |FRAME:OXYGEN-MOLECULE| (see |FRAME:PWY-101|).

/The dark reactions, better known as the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY|, comprise of the use of NADPH and

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Seeds of  the desert shrub jojoba (|FRAME: TAX-3999|) contain an unique wax, composed of esters of long-chain fatty acids (18:1, 20:1, 22:1) and long-chain alcohols. It is unique among higher plants in that the seed stores lipids in the form of liquid wax |CITS: [10712527]|.
/
/The waxes are produced in developing embryos during seed formation. The commercial interest in cultivating this plant for industrial and pharmaceutical use of its wax has lead to the identification of the biosynthetic pathways and some genes have been cloned. Transgenic technology has enabled the engineering of these genes into other plants with promising results. Several U.S patents exists for the enzymes of this pathway, given their potential use in industry |CITS: [8742713]|.
/
/This pathway is carried forward by an |FRAME: MONOMER-13889| (FAR) that is part of the integral membrane. This enzyme carries out the reduction of fatty acyl-CoA to a fatty alcohol by a four-electron transfer |CITS: [10712526]|. NADH or NADPH are used as cofactors, and the reaction proceeds through an aldehyde intermediate that is not released from the active site. These enzymes are distinct from other soluble FAR's that carry out the reduction in a two step electron transfer, the first yields an aldehyde and a second step is involved in the formation of an alcohol. 
/
/Jojoba wax synthase shares protein sequence identity with seven Arabidopsis genes, though none have been isolated yet. Co-expression of the enzyme complement of jojoba KCS, FAR and WS in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in the production of large amounts of wax in the seeds |CITS: [LASSNER99]|.
/Wax monoester production in mammals seems to be carried out by enzymes that do not resemble the plant wax synthases described in this pathway (based on the cloning and characterization of  wax synthase from mouse preputial glands) |CITS: [15220349]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Most of the carbon fixed by higher plants is used in the the synthesis of the cell wall.  In addition, smaller amounts are also incorporated into a variety of glycosylated molecules, such as glycoproteins, proteoglycans and glycolipids.  The enzymes involved in the synthesis of these molecules are known as glycosyltransferases, which utilize nucleoside 5'-diphospho-sugars (also known as or NTP-sugars, sugar nucleotides or nucleotide sugars) as donor substrates.  Two of the major points of synthesis of NTP-sugars are the synthesis of |FRAME:UDP-GLUCOSE| and |FRAME:GDP-MANNOSE|, from which most other NTP-sugars are derived.
/
/|FRAME:GDP-MANNOSE| is synthesized from |FRAME:MANNOSE-1P| and |FRAME:GTP| by a GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase.  GDP-mannose is a precursor for a number of other GDP-sugars including |FRAME:GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE| and |FRAME:GDP-L-GALACTOSE|, the latter being involved in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) biosynthesis (see |FRAME:PWY-882|).  Furthermore, GDP-mannose is important for the addition of mannose residues to cell wall molecules |CITS:[11226227]|, as well as a precursor of GDP-fucose (see |FRAME:PWY-66|), which is used to add fucose residues |CITS:[10373113],[11226227]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Rosmarinic acid (RA) is an ester of caffeic acid and 3,4-dihydrophenyllactic acid and is widely spread in species of the |FRAME:TAX-4136| and |FRAME:TAX-21571| |CITS: [12482446]| but also occurs in lower plants such as ferns and hornworts |CITS: [Takeda90]| |CITS: [12721853]|. 
/
/RA biosynthesis was first investigated in |FRAME: TAX-34256| |CITS: [5484678]| confirming the involvement of two parallel pathways for the making of rosmarinic acid. The metabolic origin for the formation of the two crucial compounds coumaroyl-CoA and 4-hydroxyphenyllactate were identified as L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine respectively. Further research led to the clarification of the biosynthetic route in |FRAME: TAX-4142| |CITS: [Petersen93]| |CITS: [12482446]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The most experimental support for the RA biosynthesis has been obtained from species of the |FRAME: TAX-4136| family elucidating the detailed enzymatic steps resulting in the formation of RA (|FRAME:PWY-5048|). However, several enzymes of this pathway possess the ability to convert different substrates with comparable efficiency indicating that the production of rosmarinic acid may also be accomplished via a pathway variant (this pathway).
/
/Two crucial steps in the RA biosynthetic route comprise the reduction of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to 4-hydroxyphenyllactate (hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase - |CITS: [15284489]|) and the subsequent connection of this RA intermediate with coumaroyl-CoA in a transesterification reaction catalyzed by rosmarinic acid synthase |CITS: [Petersen88]|. In addition to their usual monohydroxylated substrates, both enzymes convert readily the corresponding dihydroxylated substrates to 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid (DHPL) |CITS: [Hausler91]| |CITS: [15284489]| and rosmarinic acid |CITS: [Petersen91]| respectively.
/
/The enzyme catalyzing the entry step into this potential pathway is tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) and has been purified from |FRAME: TAX-3583| |CITS: [YAMAMOTO01]|. The formation of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) can also be accomplished by the action of polyphenol oxidases (EC 1.10.3.1) (e.g. |CITS: [7948897]|). The following reaction (transamination to 3,4-dihydroxypyruvate) has been found to be occurring in animals and bacteria but remains to be validated for plants. It is not known precisely at what stage in the rosmarinic acid biosynthesis the two hydroxygroups in the 3- and 3'-position of the phenolic rings are introduced. At present the depicted pathway can not be ruled out but it is more likely that the major biogenesis of RA proceeds via the pathway described in |FRAME:PWY-5048|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In this pathway multiple units of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) undergo a series of
/polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain.
/
/The sequential addition of isoprenyl units to |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| is performed by polyprenyl
/diphosphate synthase enzymes such as the |FRAME:TAX-562| enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7426|.
/
/Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by the specific enzyme.
/Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the
/polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules, such as quinones.
/The enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a
/preference towards a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone
/molecule is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/In most organisms there is one type of a predominant quinone, with a specific polyprenyl chain length.
/However, most organisms also have minor amounts of quinones with a different polyprenyl chain
/length.
/
/Organisms whose main quinone contains a chain of 7 isoprenyl units include some Gram-negative
/bacteria (for example, the gliding bacterium |FRAME: TAX-997| and the phototroph |FRAME: TAX-1049|
/strain D), but mostly Gram-positive bacteria, such as many members of the |FRAME: TAX-1386|,

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
/A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.
/
/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE CO<SUB>2</SUB>| and |FRAME: AMMONIA ammonia| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN <i>S</i>-allantoin| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE allantoate|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE xanthine| and |FRAME: URATE urate|.
/
/The initial step of GMP degradation in this pathway is the conversion of GMP to |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine|, which can be degraded to |FRAME: XANTHINE xanthine| via |FRAME: GUANINE guanine|. The enzyme that converts |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| to  |FRAME: GUANINE guanine|, guanosine deaminase, has been reported in fungi |CITS: [7551735]| and green plants |CITS: [GURANOWSKI82]|. A different route from |FRAME: GUANOSINE guanosine| to |FRAME: XANTHINE xanthine| is described in |FRAME: PWY-6607 guanosine nucleotides degradation I|.
/
/|FRAME: XANTHINE xanthine| is converted to |FRAME:URATE urate| by xanthine dehydrogenase |CITS: [14726515]|, and the latter is converted to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN <i>S</i>-allantoin| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691 urate degradation to allantoin|.
/
/This plant/fungal pathway is very similar to that found in mammals. However, mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-11783 guanosine deaminase| (EC 3.5.4.15) and instead use |FRAME: CPLX-6181 purine nucleoside phosphorylase| (EC 2.4.2.1) |CITS: [14725335]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608 guanosine nucleotides degradation III|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised <i>de novo</i> at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides. 
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|. Similarly, the salvage pathway is the sole provider of deoxyribonucleotides to be used in DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA replication in G1 cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|.
/
/The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Deoxyribonucleoside kinases salvage deoxyribonucleosides by phosphorylating them at the 5' position. The key enzymes in the salvage of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides are |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.21 "thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21)"|, (which also phosphorylates deoxyuridine) and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.74 "deoxycytidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.74)"|.
/This salvage pathway is well characterized in bacteria |CITS: [402352]|, mammals |CITS: [7494863]|, and plants |CITS: [22897443]|.
/
/Mammalian cells contain both of these kinases. In humans |FRAME: CPLX-8618| is encoded by the |FRAME: HS08100| gene, while two isozymes, encoded by |FRAME: HS09657| and |FRAME: HS09420|, catalyze thymidine kinase activity |CITS: [6281270][8380161]|.
/|FRAME: TAX-3702| posseses two thymidine kinase genes (|FRAME: AT3G07800| and |FRAME: AT5G23070|), and a broad substrate range |FRAME: AT1G72040-MONOMER| encoded by a single |FRAME: AT1G72040| gene that can phosphorylate both |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| |CITS: [22897443]|.
/Most eubacteria also employ this salvage pathway. However, some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-90370|, lack the enzyme that phosphorylates deoxycytidine |CITS: [EcoSal]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| does not have any deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and thus does not possess this pathway.
/
/In addition to these two kinases, the pathway also shows how |FRAME: DEOXYCYTIDINE| can be salvaged for the synthesis of deoxythymidine nucleotides. This is enabled by deamination to |FRAME: DEOXYURIDINE|, followed by phosphorylation by thymidine kinase to form dUMP. The latter can be converted directly to |FRAME: TMP| by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45)"|.
/
/Once formed, the monophosphates are phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis. |FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 " dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)"|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 "bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)"| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 "(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)"|. Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 "nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)"|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is the major polyphenol produced in a restricted number 
/of plant genera with |FRAME:TAX-3603|,|FRAME:TAX-3817| and <i>Pinus</i> as the prime representatives where it is formed as a general 
/response to biotic and abiotic stress |CITS: [KINDL85]| |CITS: [SCHRODER90]| |CITS: [COMMUN03]|. Resveratrol has 
/been recognized as a stilbene-type phytoalexin |CITS: [8421520]| |CITS: [9127691]| and represents a parent compound 
/of a family of molecules such as glucosides (e.g. |FRAME:CPD-6958|) |CITS: [12697026]|, methylated derivatives 
/(e.g. |FRAME:CPD-6959|) |CITS: [LANGCAKE79]| and oligomers (|FRAME:CPD-6961|, |FRAME:CPD-6960|) |CITS: [10552833]| 
/with some of them  expressing a higher fungicide toxicity than resveratrol itself.  
/
/The enzyme, stilbene synthase (STS), catalyzing the formation of either resveratrol from p-coumaryl-CoA and/or pinosylvin 
/(|FRAME:PWY-5045|) from cinnamoyl-CoA belongs to the plant specific polyketide synthases and is closely related to the 
/chalcone synthase(s) (CHS) |CITS: [2033084]| |CITS: [8083886]|. However, and although both enzymes use the same 
/condensation mechanism up to the tetraketide intermediate the ring closure is different leading to resveratrol via a aldol-type 
/cyclization and decarboxylation (STS) and to naringenin chalcone by means of a Claisen-type cyclization (CHS) |CITS: [11432743]|.
/
/While chalcone synthase is present in most higher plants stilbene synthase has a much more resticted distribution in the 
/plant kingdom. It has been demonstrated that CHS and STS share a high similarity on the DNA and protein level |CITS: [2450022]| 
/and that the enzyme(s) activity and specificity can be altered by just a few changes on the nucleotide level |CITS: [2200709]| 
/|CITS: [2033084]| |CITS: [1400374]| |CITS: [8083886]|. 
/
/Stilbenes have been shown to possess a number of attributes that makes them a desirable compound class for genetic 
/engineering. The introduction of stilbene synthase to plant species devoid of this enzymes leads to the formation of resveratrol 
/|CITS: [2103451]| and its 3-O-glucosid (piceid) |CITS: [KOBAYASHI00]| |CITS: [8421520]|, at the same time diminishing the 
/content of the antinutritive sinapate esters in |FRAME:TAX-3708| |CITS: [16160820]| (|FRAME:PWY-3301|) or enhancing 
/the tolerance against the grapevine mold <i>Botrytis cinera</i> |CITS: [11432907]|. The often observed glucosylation of 
/resveratrol has been discussed as protective measure to prevent molecules from enzymic oxidation and therefore extending 
/the half-life of these compounds in the cell |CITS: [12697026]|. The increase or introduction of resveratrol and its derivatives 
/in plants is highly beneficial for the human diet since stilbenes have been demonstrated to have cardioprotective effects and 
/anticancer properties |CITS: [15517885]| |CITS: [9127691]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Resveratrol is synthesized from p-coumaroyl-CoA and 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA. The 
/enzyme stilbene (or resveratrol) synthase is not very specific and can also accept other CoA esters, aliphatic as well as 
/aromatic ones as primers for poylyketide synthesis including substrates not being present in plants |CITS: [12620343]| 
/|CITS: [11432743]|. It is therefore considered as one of the major generators of carbon skeleton diversity in natural products 
/|CITS: [Schroder99]|.
/
/A common observation for this type of reactions is the occurrence of derailment products such as bis-noryangonin and 
/p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone. The formation of bis-noryangonin has been detected in most stilbene synthase catalyzed 
/reactions |CITS: [12620343]| |CITS: [11432743]| and has been described as an artificial bye-product of the chalcone/stilbene 
/synthase reaction after the addition of 2 malonyl-CoA |CITS: [1155951]|. However, the enzyme responsible for the catalysis 
/of bisnoryangonin, i.e. styrylpyrone synthase has been partially purified from |FRAME:TAX-3258| and demonstrated 
/to be different from chalcone oder stilbene synthase. The enzyme also accepts with lower efficiency caffeoyl-CoA which 
/leads to the formation of hispidin (|FRAME:CPD-6989|) representing another styrylpyrone detected in this more primitive 
/gametophyte |CITS: [BECKERT97]|.
/
/The formation of p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone is catalyzed by a novel enzyme distinct from stilbene synthase 
/|CITS: [10469148]|. The enzyme converts p-coumaryl-CoA and 3 molecules of malonyl-CoA to a novel pyrone, a linear 
/tetraketide which has been elongated but not cyclized, i.e. p-coumaroyltriacetate. The final cyclization to p-coumaryltriacetic 
/acid lactone occurs spontaneously.

/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in the salvage of the pyrimidine nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| is (|FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.9)"| (UPRT), which transfers a phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to uracil, generating |FRAME: UMP| in a single step. The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants |CITS: [16660311][216696][2189783][8856065][11773618][14658380]|. This pathway was shown to be the major route for uracil salvage in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.
/
/Mammals lack the enzyme, and thereby are unable to perform the one-step salvage of uracil |CITS: [15685165]| and are limited to recycling pyrimidine nucleosides via uridine kinases (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|).
/
/Some archaea, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that possess the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7932| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 "EC 3.5.4.1"|) are also able to salvage exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by converting it to |FRAME: URACIL| (see |FRAME: PWY-7194|).
/
/Once the nucleobases are converted to |FRAME: UMP|, it can be phosphorylated to form the RNA building blocks |FRAME: UTP| and |FRAME: CTP| by the enzymes that participate in the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway, as described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7176|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the carboxylation and oxygenation of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| (RuBP).  The carboxylation process is generally known as CO<SUB>2</SUB> fixation (|FRAME:CALVIN-PWY|) whereas the oxygenation process is known as photorespiration (this pathway).  Oxygenation of RuBP leads to the production of one molecule of |FRAME:G3P| and one of |FRAME:CPD-67|.  The two substrates (O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) are competitive with regard to rubisco, so that an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inhibits oxygenation and vice versa |CITS:[Bowyer97]|.  Another important factor influencing the rate of oxygenation is temperature.  Photorespiration is enhanced by high temperature.  The reasons for this are twofold: (i) as temperatures increase the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> diminishes more rapidly than that of O<sub>2</sub> and (ii) the specificity factor (&Omega;) of Rubisco (which represents a measure of the relative specificity of CO<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>2</sub>) decreases with increasing temperatures between 7C and 35C.
/
/Under conditions of low CO<SUB>2</SUB> and high O<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations, RuBP is oxidized to 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycolate. The latter cannot be used in the |FRAME:CALVIN-PWY| and, instead, is salvaged in the photorespiration pathway.
/
/This salvage pathway involves three types of organelles: chloroplasts, peroxisomes and mitochondria. The main features of this pathway include: (i) the conversion of two-carbon molecule, 2-phosphoglycolate, into glycine; (ii) the decarboxylation of two glycines, which generates serine, CO<SUB>2</SUB> and NH<SUB>3</SUB>; and (iii) the conversion of the three-carbon serine into 3-phosphoglycerate, which re-enters the CO<sub>2</SUB> fixation |FRAME:CALVIN-PWY|.
/
/The first step of the pathway involves the dephosphorylation of |FRAME:CPD-67|, which not only recycles Pi within the chloroplast but also prevents accumulation of 2-phosphoglycolate, a potent inhibitor of triose-P isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1).  In its dephosphorylated form |FRAME:GLYCOLLATE| is exported to the cytoplasm where it is oxidized in the peroxisomes to |FRAME:GLYOX|.  The |FRAME:HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| generated during this step is detoxified by catalases (see |FRAME:DETOX1-PWY|; |CITS: [15012254]|) in the peroxisome.  Glyoxylate is then converted into |FRAME:GLY| by two different enzymes: serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.45) and glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.4).  The actual desired outcome is the conversion of glyoxylate into |FRAME:OH-PYR|, which is the other products of serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (|FRAME:SERINE-GLYOXYLATE-AMINOTRANSFERASE-RXN|).  Glycine is in fact converted into serine in the mitochondrion by glycine decarboxylase where it is extremely abundant.  Glycine decarboxylase has four different subunit (P, H, T and L), which catalyze the transfer of a methylene group from glycine to |FRAME:THF| with the concomitant release of NH<SUB>3</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and production of NADH.  [<b>Note:</b> NH<SUB>3</SUB>, which is an extremely valuable resource, is efficiently refixed by glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) in the chloroplast.  Moreover, the release of CO<sub>2</sub> during the formation of serine decreases the overall efficiency of photosynthesis.]  The methylene group is then transferred to another glycine molecule to form serine by a serine hydroxylmetyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1).  Back in the peroxisome, serine is used to convert glyoxylate into |FRAME:OH-PYR| via serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.45) as mentioned above.  The last of the peroxisome steps consists in the reduction of hydroxypyruvate into |FRAME:GLYCERATE| by an NADH-dependent hydroxypyruvate reductase.  Glycerate is then redirected to the chloroplast where it is phosphorylated to |FRAME:G3P| and reenters the Calvin cycle.
/
/The outcome of photorespiration is loss of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and energy in photosynthetic cells.  The biological function of photorespiration is not clear. One possibility is that photorespiration is necessary under conditions of high light intensity and low CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration (i.e. when stomata is closed under water stress) to dissipate excess ATP and reducing power from the photosynthesis light reactions, thus to prevent damage to the photosynthetic apparatus.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration. It generates energy and reducing power. Respiration is an ATP-generating process in which compounds act as electron donors through a chain of electron transfer to electron acceptors. Aerobic respiration uses oxygen as the final acceptor. Anaerobic respiration uses several organic compounds as acceptors such as fumarate, nitrate and hydrogen. During the chain of electron transfer, protons (H+) are transported outside the cytoplasmic membrane, generating a proton motive force (PMF). Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, the PMF energy is captured as ATP, catalyzed by a multisubunit ATPase |CITS: [15134745]|.
/
/<b> About This Pathway </b>
/
/One of the main differences between the eukaryotic TCA cycles (including the one described in this pathway) and the
/prokaryotic |FRAME: TCA| is that the later contains an alternative route between |FRAME: MAL| and
/|FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EG12069-MONOMER|
/(EC 1.1.99.16). That enzyme is found in some bacteria, but is absence from most eukaryotes,
/in which the reaction is catalyzed only by the |FRAME: ENSG00000146701-MONOMER| (EC 1.1.1.37).
/
/Another difference concerns the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. Prokaryotes possess only an
/|FRAME: MONOMER-13167| form, which supports both respiration via the TCA cycle
/and glutamate biosynthesis for anabolic reactions.
/Eukaryotes, on the other hand, have two types of the enzyme - NADP-dependent forms (EC 1.1.1.42)
/and NAD-dependent forms (EC 1.1.1.41). It has been shown that the NADP-dependent enzymes are
/involved primarily in glutamate biosynthesis, while the NAD-dependent enzymes are involved in respiration
/|CITS: [2198251]|.
/
/This pathway has an additional reaction which distinguishes it from the standard |FRAME: PWY-5690 eukaryotic TCA cycle|. In the other eukaryotic pathway, and also shown here, |FRAME: MAL| can cycle through the pathway first by being transformed into |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and then |FRAME: CIT| through the activities of malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. The |FRAME: ACETYL-COA| that is used by citrate synthase is typically assumed to be derived from |FRAME: PYRUVATE| that comes from glycolysis. However, in this pathway variant, the NAD-dependent malic enzymes provide an alternative source of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| via oxidative decarboxylation of |FRAME: MAL| |CITS: [18223148][20528775][7294802]|. The |FRAME: MAL| is shown here as being derived from the TCA cycle, however, it can also enter the pathway from vacuolar |FRAME: MAL| reserves |CITS: [18223148][20528775]|. Experiments in corn suggest that this alternative source of TCA intermediates may be especially important under conditions of high energy demand when pyruvate transport is limiting. Under these circumstances, malate can be rapidly transported into the mitochondria and can replenish pyruvate supplies |CITS: [16659908]|. In animal mitochondria, exogenous malate is not readily oxidized |CITS: [7294802]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This is a superpathway composed of one or more sub-pathways that may have different levels of evidence.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This superpathway combines multiple routes in which some organisms (including bacteria, yeast and plants) can salvage the pyrimidine ribonucleosides |FRAME: CYTIDINE| and |FRAME: URIDINE| and convert them to the ribonucleotide |FRAME: UMP|, which can serve as a precursor for the synthesis of all other pyrimidine nucleotides.
/
/Since most of the salvage enzymes have higher activity with |FRAME: URIDINE|, most of the available |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is coverted to |FRAME: URIDINE| by cytidine deaminase, |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.5|.
/
/|FRAME: URIDINE Uridine| is then converted to UMP in one of two routes. In the first route, this transformation is achieved in a single step by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.48 "uridine kinase (EC 2.7.1.48)"|. In most organisms this enzyme is also active with |FRAME: CYTIDINE|, and thus can form |FRAME: CMP| as well (although this has not been shown yet for the plant enzymes).
/
/In the second route, |FRAME: URIDINE| is first hydrolyzed to the nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| by |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3 "uridine nucleosidase (EC 3.2.2.3)"|, and the nucleobase is phosphoribosylated to UMP by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.9)"|.
/
/Mammals have not been included in this superpathway, since they do not have the enzyme uridine nucleosidase and thus can not convert uridine to uracil. They do utilize a nucleoside kinase-based pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7183|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-110 "Salicylic acid"| (salicylate; SA) is an aromatic compound commonly found throughout the plant kingdom that is also found in some bacteria.
/
/In plants |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| affects numerous biological and physiological processes, including plant defense (via the systematic acquired resistance system |CITS: [15283665][12873532]|), allelopathy, flowering, and stomatal movement |CITS: [SCHULZ93]|. Given its important signaling role, plants often chemically modify |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| by attaching glycosyl, methyl, or other groups to |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| to alters its activity, volatility, or other properties |CITS [PIERPOINT94][SCHULZ93]|. One of the potential glucose-conjugates |FRAME: CPD-12629 salicylate &beta;-D-glucose ester| (SGE), has been detected in a number of plant species, including |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| |CITS: [18248508]|, |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>|, |FRAME: TAX-4075 <i>Datura inoxia</i>|, and <i>Thlaspi goesingense</i>|CITS: [15734913]|. The specific biological role of |FRAME: CPD-12629 SGE| is still under investigation. Unlike the other SA glucose,  |FRAME: CPD-12628 salicylate 2-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| (SAG), SGE is not expected to be a more water soluable form of the compound, and there is evidence that it is not accepted by the vacuolar transporters that require a negative charge |CITS: [15032822][15871031]|. SGE may serve as a high energy intermediate form of |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| that can be used in additional biochemical pathways, or, it may be another storage form of this important signaling compound |CITS: [18248508]|. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The formation of  |FRAME: CPD-12629 SGE| has been demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> using glucosyltransferases in several plant species, including |FRAME: TAX-35883 <i>Ipomoea nil</i>| |CITS: [17692286]|, |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>| |CITS: [10593966]|, and |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| |CITS: [18248508]|. In general, the enzymes from these organisms do not have high substrate specificity which may be a beneficial trait that allows the enzymes to detoxify numerous potential xenobiotics.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Steviol glucosides are the sweet principles found in <i>Stevia rebaundiana</i> and are worldwide increasingly used as natural, low-calorie sweeteners that substitute for sucrose to counteract growing incidence of obesity and diabetes. |FRAME:CPD-14504 Stevioside| has been reported to be 300 times sweeter than sucrose |CITS:[18556105]| |CITS:[ Lemus-Mondaca12]|. The main steviol glucosides |FRAME:CPD-14504| and |FRAME:CPD-14506| are also thermostable making them suitable for use in cooked foods |CITS:[ Lemus-Mondaca12]|. Because of the extensive use of steviol glucosides in human health and food these compounds have been thoroughly investigated and found to be neither genotoxic |CITS:[19427890]| |CITS:[18556105]| nor carcinogen or toxic in reproduction processes and have been approved for diabetes patients |CITS:[22492420]| |CITS:[18555575]| |CITS:[14561506]|. 
/
/Steviol glucosides have also been reported to be effective in various <i>in vitro</i> anticancer tests acting as chemopreventive agents for chemical carcinogenesis |CITS:[19131254]| and offer therapeutic benefits through anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions |CITS:[19000919]|. The steviol glucosides have been found to be efficient scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicating their involvement in the antioxidant defense strategy of plants to thwart oxidative stress |CITS:[21043580]|. 
/
/All the glucosidic derivatives of steviol (see |FRAME:PWY-7070|) shown in the |FRAME:PWY-7071| have been detected in varying amounts in <i>Stevia rebaundiana</i> |CITS:[21417451]| |CITS:[20102764]| |CITS:[Rajasekaran08]|. Three out of four UDP glucosyltransferases involved in the steviol glucoside biosynthesis have been isolated from EST collections and shown to regio-selectively glucosylate multiple steps in the pathway |CITS:[15610349]| |CITS:[16667943]| |CITS:[7646064]|. The recombinant UTG85C2 glucosylated the C-13 hydroxyl group catalyzing the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-14501| to |FRAME:CPD-14502| |CITS:[15610349]| and was also capable to act in tandem with an endogenous |FRAME:TAX-3701| enzyme to glucosylate |FRAME:CPD-14508| forming |FRAME:CPD-14505| |CITS:[16786291]|. UTG74G1 acted on the C-19-hydroxyl of the C-4 carboxyl group catalyzing the formation of the corresponding glucosyl esters. UTG74G1 exhibited multiple glucosylation activities towards |FRAME:CPD-14501| forming |FRAME:CPD-14508|, |FRAME:CPD-14502| resulting in |FRAME:CPD-14505| synthesis and the glucosylation of |FRAME:CPD-14503| producing |FRAME:CPD-14504| |CITS:[15610349]|. The last characterized UTG, i.e. UTG76G1 was shown to transfer glucose to the C-2' and C-3' of the 13-O-glucose and catalyzed the glucosylation of |FRAME:CPD-14503| forming |FRAME:CPD-14507|, and |FRAME:CPD-14504| resulting in the production of |FRAME:CPD-14506|. The remaining fourth, and so far unidentified UGT is thought to be involved in the glucosylation of |FRAME:CPD-14502| producing |FRAME:CPD-14503| and |FRAME:CPD-14505| glucosylation which would form |FRAME:CPD-14504| |CITS:[15610349]|.
/
/The main route from |FRAME:CPD-14501| towards |FRAME:CPD-14506| based on the existing biochemical data has been proposed to be |FRAME:CPD-14501| to |FRAME:CPD-14502|, |FRAME:CPD-14503|, |FRAME:CPD-14504| and finally |FRAME:CPD-14506|. |FRAME:CPD-14503 Steviobioside| seems to be an common intermediate of two routes leading to |FRAME:CPD-14506|, one via |FRAME:CPD-14504| and the other having |FRAME:CPD-14507| as intermediate |CITS:[15610349]|. Based on the correlation of transcripts and steviol glucoside accumulation the entry reaction catalyzed by UTG85C2 has been proposed to be the rate-limiting step of the pathway |CITS:[21477883]|.

COMMENT - Jasmonic acid (JA), its cyclic precursors and derivatives are collectively referred to as jasmonates (JAs). Jasmonates are important intracellular regulators mediating diverse developmental processes, such as seed germination, flower and fruit development, leaf abscission, and senescence |CITS: [11607536]|. In addition, jasmonates induce plant defense responses against a group of pathogens |CITS: [10066616]| and mechanical or herbivorous insect-driven wounding |CITS: [1594598]|. 
/
/JA biosynthesis starts with the conversion of linolenate to 12-oxo-phytodienoate (OPDA) in the chloroplast, by sequential actions of lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC).  OPDA once formed in the chloroplast needs to be transported into the peroxisome where it is reduced by OPDA reductase to give rise to 3-oxo-2(cis-2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoate (OPC8). OPC8, in its CoA form, is converted to JA by shortening six carbons from the octanoate side chain via three cycles of beta oxidation. The final steps of JA synthesis is catalyzed by three core enzymes of the beta-oxidation cycle, acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX), multifunctional protein containing 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT).
/
/JA biosynthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level. Strong correlation of gene expression of the Arabidopsis OPR3 (At2g06050) with 13-LOX (At1g72520, At1g17420), AOC (At3g25780), AOS (At5g42650) and OPCL1 (At1g20510) was reported in |CITS: [16963437]|.

COMMENT - Homogalacturonan (HGA) is a linear chain of 1,4-linked a-D-galacturonic acid residues in which some of the carboxyl groups are methyl esterified. HGA accounts for up to 60% of the pectin found in primary cell walls of all plants.
/
/To synthesize HGA, UDP-galacturonate is formed from UDP-glucuronate in the cytosol. UDP- galacturonate is then transported into the Golgi by a proposed UDP- galacturonate:UMP antiporter. The galacturonate residue is transferred onto a growing HGA chain. Some of the newly added galacturonate residues are methyl esterifed at the C-6 carboxyl group. Vesicles containing the newly synthesized HGA are targeted to and fuse with the plasmamembrane thereby releasing the HGA into the exocellular space for subsequent incorporation into the wall.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Glutathione plays many important roles in plants. It helps maintain redox homeostasis,
/protects against photosynthetically-generated hydrogen peroxide, aids in the sequestration of xenobiotics and heavy metals,
/participates in cell cycle regulation, and contributes to the amino acid pools |CITS:[18768907]|. There is evidence that plants
/and animals share many similar enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism, however, they appear to employ these
/enzymes differently |CITS:[18768907]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: 
/This pathway was identified in plants many years after the discovery of the |FRAME:PWY-4041| pathway.
/There are a few important differences that distinguish this pathway. First of all, it appears to occur within the cell
/and may not require the import of compounds from the extracellular space. Second, the &gamma;-glutamyl
/cyclotransferase(s) in the plant pathway seem to act directly on glutathione, &gamma;-glutamylcysteine, or
/other &gamma;-glutamyl conjugates, so it does not require the activity of &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidases
/|CITS:[18768907]|. Glutathione is likely to be the primary target of  GGC activity in Arabidopsis because
/&gamma;-glutamylcysteine is present at much lower levels in cells and its concentration does not seem
/to strongly affect 5OP synthesis |CITS:[18768907]|.
/
/Many of the later steps of the pathway are conserved between the |FRAME: PWY-4041| variant and this pathway.
/
/First, 5-oxoprolinase (5OPase) produces 5-oxoproline |CITS:[18768907]|.  Similar
/experiments from other plants also confirm the presence of these enzymatic activities
/|CITS:[7445678]| |CITS:[16660609]| |CITS:[11302195]|. The final steps to close
/the cycle are carried out by glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione-synthase. The formation of the
/amide linkage between cysteine and glutamate is catalyzed by the glutamate-cysteine ligase; the reaction
/has been regarded as rate-limiting step in the formation of glutathione and was characterized in
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [1112810]| |CITS: [MAY94]|. Glutathione synthetase is a
/physiological dimer and catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of L-&gamma;-glutamylcysteine to glutathione.
/The enzyme has been found and characterized in Arabidopsis confirming its molecular function by recombinant
/expressed protein and functional complementation of glutathione synthase deficient heterologous organisms
/|CITS: [8612643]| |CITS: [8914526]| |CITS: [15302873]|.
/
/Interestingly, this pathway, and more specifically, 5OP, may be a significant contributor to glutamate pools in
/the leaves, flowers, and siliques (but not roots) of Arabidopsis plants |CITS:[18768907]|.

COMMENT - <B>General Info </B>
/Phosphoglycerides (phospholipids) are major membrane lipids found in nature which have phosphate as 
/their hydrophilic heads.  In contrast, the plant plastid (including chloroplast) membrane only has 
/phosphoglycerides as a minor constituent.  Instead, glycosylglycerides (glycolipids) are the main 
/membrane lipids, which have sugars as their hydrophilic heads. There are three important 
/glycosylglycerides: monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), and 
/sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG, see |FRAME: PWYQT-4427|). Both MGDG and 
/DGDG have galactose as the sugar group and are also known as galactolipids. SQDG has sulfoquinovose as the sugar group and is thus known as sulfolipid. All these glycosylglycerides are synthesized within the chloroplast using diacylglycerol (DAG) as the substrate.

/In plants, DAG and DAG-derived glycosylglycerides are classified as either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The prokaryotic pathway uses fatty acids synthesized de novo in plastids. Because of the substrate specificity of plastid acyltransferases, the DAG pool made from the prokaryotic pathway has 16-carbon fatty acids at the sn-2 position of glycerol backbone, and 18-carbon at the sn-1 position. The C18/C16 structure is similar to that of cyanobacteria glycerolipids and is called prokaryotic. In the eukaryotic pathway, fatty acids synthesized in plastids are exported to cytosol, and are used in endoplasmic reticulum for the synthesis of DAG. Because of the substrate specificity of ER isozyme acyltransferases, the DAG pool is highly enriched with 18-carbon fatty acids at sn-1 and sn-2 positions. The C18/C18 structure is only found in eukaryotic lipids, and is thus called eukaryotic.

/<B>About this pathway </B>
/In Arabidopsis, MGD1 and DGD1 are responsible for the bulk of MGDG and DGDG biosynthesis, respectively. MGD2, MGD3 and DGD2 are of conditional importance in glycolipid biosynthesis when the plants are under phosphate deprivation.  
/
/In addition to MGDG and DGDG, under certain circumstances, plants can synthesize higher galactosylated forms of galactoglycerolipids by a galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase (GGGT). The GGGT activity is not detectable in plants under normal growth conditions. Since GGGT activity also generates a DAG molecule, by providing DAG, it is postulated to be involved in remodeling of MGDG or triacylglycerol biosynthesis in extreme conditions.

/Unlike the microbial aspartate superpathway where O-succinyl-homoserine is the intermediate for methionine
/biosynthesis from homoserine whereas O-phospho-homoserine is the intermediate for threonine biosynthesis
/(see |FRAME: P4-PWY|), plants utilize O-phospho-homoserine for the synthesis of both methionine and threonine.
/Thus in the plant aspartate superpathway O-phospho-homoserine is the branching point for methione and threonine

/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  
/
/An important branch-point in the biosynthesis of carotenoids lies in the cyclization of the linear, pink
/|FRAME:CPD1F-114| into carotenes with all-&beta;-, all-&epsilon;- or mixed &beta; and &epsilon; rings.
/The cyclization reactions are catalyzed by lycopene &beta;- or &epsilon;-cyclases.
/These cyclases all share a conserved amino acid sequence signature and bind dinucleotides such as
/FAD and NADP |CITS:[8837512]|, but otherwise share little resemblance.
/
/A single cyclization reaction by |FRAME: MONOMER-12151| results in the formation of
/|FRAME: CPD1F-115|. A second cyclization is performed by |FRAME: MONOMER-12154|,
/generating |FRAME: CPD1F-118|. A second cyclization by |FRAME: MONOMER-12151| is unlikely,
/as the &epsilon;-cyclase does not seem to be able to add a second &epsilon; ring to
/the monocyclic |FRAME: CPD1F-115| |CITS:[8837512]|.
/
/It has been postulated that the regulation of &epsilon;-cyclase, possibly through control of gene
/expression, determines xanthophylls composition in leaves and other plant tissues, since its products
/(&delta;-carotene) is destined to the &alpha;-carotene branch |CITS:[10205893]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Gluconeogenesis is the generation of glucose from non-sugar carbon substrates such as |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, |FRAME: GLYCEROL|, and glucogenic amino acids (primarily |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| and |FRAME: GLN|). The process is essentially the reversal of the |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS glycolysis| pathway. However, two glycolytic enzymes catalyze irreversible reactions. In order to enable the pathway to flow in the direction of glucose production, these reactions are catalyzed by other enzymes (|FRAME:EC-3.1.3.11| and |FRAME:EC-2.7.9.2|) in the opposite direction.
/
/The pathway is particularly important in animals, as the production of glucose from other metabolites is necessary for use as a fuel source by the brain, testes, erythrocytes and kidney medulla, all of which can use only glucose as the energy source.
/
/Gluconeogenesis in animals is perfomed mostly in the liver. The pathway is carried by cytoplasmic enzymes to the level of |FRAME: GLC-6-P|. Since free glucose tends to freely diffuse out of the cell, actual glucose formation is carried out in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by |FRAME: HS05538-MONOMER|. Glucose is then shuttled into the cytosol by glucose transporters.
/
/The main souces of carbon for gluconeogenesis in animals is |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, formed in skeletal muscle cells during anaerobic glycolysis and carried to the liver in the blood stream. The conversion of glucose into lactate by glycolysis and back to glucose by gluconeogenesis is referred to as the Cori Cycle |CITS:[5355347][10484349]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This pathway is found in several sulfur-oxidizing organisms, including the facultative chemolithotroph |FRAME: TAX-921| and the acidophilic thiobacilli. Acidithiobacilii are prominent bacteria that catalyse the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds under acidic conditions (pH 1 to 3) and ambient temperatures. Important members include the Acidithiobacillus and Acidiphilium spp., which can grow chemolithoautotrophically with sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate or polythionates |CITS: [9828441][10758854]|.
/
/Earlier work by Sugio et al concluded that |FRAME: TAX-920| possesses a sulfur dioxygenase capable of using |FRAME: HS| as substrate |CITS: [3667519][Sugio89][16348640]|. However, in a later study conducted by Rohwerder and Sand |CITS: [12855721]| it was shown that cell-free systems from several members of the |FRAME: TAX-119977| and |FRAME: TAX-522| oxidized sulfide only via |FRAME: CPD-11281| (GSSH), a non-enzymic reaction product from |FRAME:OXIDIZED-GLUTATHIONE| (GSSG) and |FRAME: HS|.
/
/The enzyme that oxidizes the sulfur, the periplasmic |FRAME:CPLX-7137|, cannot accept either elemental sulfur or |FRAME: HS|, and is specific for  the sulfane sulfur of monoorganylpolysulfanes (RS<sub>n</sub>H, where n>1),
/and predominantly persulfides (where n=2), which is oxidized to sulfite in the presence of molecular oxygen and water.
/Organic persulfides such as |FRAME: CPD-11281| could not be replaced by other sulfane-sulfur-containing compounds (thiosulfate, polythionates, bisorganylpolysulfanes or monoarylthiosulfonates) as sulfur donor.
/
/These results provided a new interpretation for the earliest results of Sugio et al.(1989). The assay in Sugio's work required 8 mM of glutathione for activity, and is likely to have contained |FRAME: OXIDIZED-GLUTATHIONE| due to autoxidation |CITS: [12855721]|.
/
/It is not clear how this system relates to another sulfide-oxidizing enzyme found in |FRAME: TAX-920|, 
/|FRAME:MONOMER-12369| (see |FRAME:P222-PWY|).
/
/The product of the sulfur dioxygenase activity was shown to be |FRAME:SO3|, which is subsequently oxidized to |FRAME:SULFATE| |CITS: [5142118][Nakamura95][deJong2000]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/ verbascose and ajugose are two members of the so-called 'raffinose series' of sucrosyl oligosaccharides (also known as raffinose family oligosaccharides, RFOs).  Sucrosyl oligosaccharides represent a large portion of primary oligosaccharides in plants (defined as oligosaccharides synthesized by the action of a glycosyl transferase that mediates the transfer of a glycopyranosyl residue to either the glucopyranosyl or fructofuranosyl moiety of sucrose.  They are differentiated from secondary oligosaccharides which are generated by the hydrolysis of higher oligosaccharides, polysaccharides or heterosides.  For review, see |CITS:[KANDLER82]|).  Members of the raffinose series occur at least in traces in each plant family; it is one of the most widespread sucrosyl oligosaccharide series in flowering plants and might even be ubiquitous (see |CITS:[KANDLER82]| for review).  This series comprises |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8065|,|FRAME:CPD-8066| (see also |FRAME:PWY-5342|) as well as several other compounds with a higher degree of polymerization (DP; the highest is a nonasaccharide; none of these higher-DP oligosaccharides in the series have not yet been named).  The sugars of this series consist of &alpha;1,6-linked chains of D-galactose attached to the 6-glucosyl position of sucrose.  They are synthesized in leaves, roots and tubers.  Raffinose and stachyose are the two most commonly found oligosaccharides of this series (see |FRAME:PWY-5337|).  However, higher RFOs with DP are also found in certain species such as the frost-hardy |FRAME:TAX-38596|, in which both short-chain and long-chain RFOs are present and have been speculated to act as antifreeze or antisalt agents |CITS:[12232288],[12228647],[12223871],[10758476]|.  The biosynthesis of higher-DP RFOs appears to occurs via two routes: one is dependent on galactinol, and requires enzymes similar to that of the |FRAME:PWY-5337| pathway, the other does not appear to require galactinol (this pathway).  This latter route has been discovered recently |CITS:[12232288],[12060258]|.
/
/<i>Enzymes of the pathway:</i>  A single enzyme has been described that can catalyze all the polymerization steps of this pathway.  This enzyme, galactan:galactan galactosyltransferase, catalyzes the chain elongation of RFOs by transferring a terminal &alpha;-galactosyl residue from one RFO molecule to another instead of using galactinol as galactosyl donor |CITS:[12060258],[15034167]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The citrulline degradation pathway is widely distributed among prokaryotic organisms 
/but occurs also in eukaryotic organisms, often associated with the degradation of arginine into citrulline 
/(e.g. |FRAME: ARG-PRO-PWY|).
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The enzymes of this pathway, as well as arginine deiminase, have also been found 
/in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, and it was shown that Arabidopsis chloroplasts can metabolize arginine and 
/citrulline all the way to CO<sub>2</sub>. However, since Arabidopsis rarely encounters exogenous citrulline, it is 
/thought that in this organism the pathway may serve as a means for extracting nitrogen from endogenous sources 
/|CITS: [8278506]|. 
/
/Organisms that employ this pathway use the enzyme ornithine carbamoyltransferase to convert |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| 
/to |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| and |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|. The latter is then broken into |FRAME: AMMONIA| 
/and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an ATP-forming reaction, catalyzed by the enzyme carbamate kinase. The 
/ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC) has been identified from a T-DNA-tagged mutant of Arabidopsis and has 
/been shown to be encoded by a gene that overlaps with another, unrelated gene (AUL1), one of the rare cases 
/of gene convergence observed in Arabidopsis |CITS: [10561504]|. Ornithine carbamoyltransferase has also been 
/cloned from other plant sources such as <i>Pisum sativum</i> |CITS: [8914525]| and <i>Canavalia lineata</i> 
/|CITS: [10987149]| |CITS: [11575720]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4081| cotyledons, the major intermediates of phenylpropanoid metabolism are chlorogenic acid and |FRAME: 2-O-CAFFEOYLGLUCARATE|. In quantitative analysis these two compounds appear to be in a precursor-product relation. Protein extracts of tomato cotyledons were able to catalyze the formation of caffeoylglucaric acid when chlorogenic acid was supplied as the acyl donor |CITS: [16665274]|. Glucaric acid is the oxidation product of glucose and |FRAME: 2-O-CAFFEOYLGLUCARATE| is the acylated product.
/
/The biosynthesis of the hydrocinnamic acid esters has for long been thought be similar to the caffeic acid ester, the chlorogenic acid. Alternate routes of enzymic synthesis are being pursued such as the possibility of chlorogenic acid acting as an acyl donor molecule for caffeoyltransferases |CITS: [16667263]|. 
/
/Leaves of |FRAME: TAX-4081| plants accumulate caffeate esters with quinate, glucarate and galactarate. These esters are formed by the action of three enzymes; caffeate CoA ligase, caffeoyl-CoA quinate caffeoyltransferase and chlorogenate-glucarate caffeoyltransferase as shown in the above pathway |CITS: [20880851]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This is a superpathway composed of one or more sub-pathways that may have different levels of evidence.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The first purine nucleotide that is synthesized <i>de novo</i> is |FRAME: IMP| (IMP). IMP is converted to |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER|, and the latter is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, |FRAME: AMP| (AMP), by the action of |FRAME:AMPSYN-ENZRXN|.
/
/AMP is phosphorylated to ADP and subsequently to ATP. While the first phosphorylation is catalyzed by the dedicated enzyme |FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|, reactions that convert ADP to ATP are numerous and found in multiple pathways,  including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis. However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: CPLX490-3510 ATP synthase| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes the proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP. This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.
/
/ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form |FRAME: DADP| (dADP) by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate reductase. Once formed, dADP can be phosphorylated into the DNA building block |FRAME: DATP dATP| by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|.
/
/In bacterial systems genetic studies indicate that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the `purR' repressor protein |CITS:[2404765]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The biosynthesis of several important metabolites involves the consumption of |FRAME: MET| through the utilization of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), in a reaction that releases |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA).
/These metabilites include polyamines (see |FRAME: ARGSPECAT-PWY|, |FRAME:BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-1303|), |FRAME: ETHYLENE-CMPD| (see |FRAME: ETHYL-PWY|), and bacterial auto-inducers (see |FRAME: PWY-6157|).
/
/|FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration is tightly regulated through the methionine salvage cycle, where MTA is recycled through a series of reactions back to |FRAME: MET|.
/
/The methionine salvage pathway, also called the Yang cycle, is present with some variations in all types of organisms |CITS: [19946895]| (|FRAME: TAX-562| is a notorious exception). It has been partially characterized from a number of organisms, including bacteria |CITS:[8227039][7852397][8694776][9880484][11371200]|, plants |CITS: [Baur72][Murr75][Kushad83][Miyazaki87]|, yeast |CITS: [3906034]|, protozoal parasites |CITS: [8585735][ 11443076]| and rat |CITS: [7007366][7068632][7852397]|. The pathway was best studied in the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-573|.
/
/While most of the pathway is conserved among all organisms, several variants exist that differ in the initial steps of the pathway, between |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) and |FRAME: CPD-1063| (MTRP). These variants, describing bacteria and plants, higher eukaryotes, and protozoa, are described by several pathways under |FRAME: Methylthioadenosine-Degradation|.
/This metabolic differences in the early steps of the methionine salvage pathway are being exploited for developing new drugs targeted against pathogenic microorganisms |CITS: [2854458][2153115][1929327]|.
/
/Several variants of the methionine salvage cycle are available in MetaCyc. The pathway shown here operates in plants and includes a reaction leading to  |FRAME: ETHYLENE-CMPD| biosynthesis.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here depicts the formation of MTA by the production of  |FRAME: ETHYLENE-CMPD|, although MTA is also formed during the biosynthesis of polyamines (as described in |FRAME: PWY-7528|).
/
/The pathway was discovered in plants by Baur and Yang |CITS:[baur72]| while studying |FRAME: ETHYL-PWY "ethylene biosynthesis"| in apple fruit tissue. They noticed that although initial methionine quantities were only sufficient for the production of ethylene for a few hours, ethylene was being produced for months. Since no volatile sulfur was detected, they had concluded that the methionine pool had to be replenished during ethylene production.
/
/Indeed, the pathway plays an important role in plants by preventing the depletion of methionine pools during times of ethylene production. When |FRAME: CPD-68| is siphoned off to produce ethylene, the methylthio group of |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) is recycled to methionine via this pathway. 
/
/Unlike in higher eukaryotes, where the recycling of MTA to methionine starts with phosphorolytic cleavage by |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.28| to yield |FRAME: CPD-444|, in most bacteria and plants this conversion is achieved by the action of two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.16| and |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.100|, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-560| |CITS: [8694776][10574451]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6754|).
/
/Once |FRAME: CPD-444| is formed, it is recycled back to L-methionine in 6 steps, comprising an isomerase, a dehydratase, an enolase, a phosphatase, an oxygenase, and a transaminase. The last enzyme, a glutamine-dependent transaminase, produces the byproduct |FRAME: 2-KETO-GLUTARAMATE|, which is believed to be toxic. Thus an additional enzyme, an &omega;-amidase that converts the latter to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, is also considered a part of the pathway |CITS: [24837359]|.
/
/<b>A note about |FRAME: EC-1.13.11.54|</b>
/
/The reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.13.11.54|, can occur non-enzymatically in the presence of air. It is yet unknown whether the non-enzymatic reaction occurs <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [7852397]|.
/If the enzyme that usually catalyzes this reaction binds a Ni<sup>2+</sup> instead of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, it catalyzes a different reaction (|FRAME: EC-1.13.11.53|), forming a shunt of the methionine salvage pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5389|) |CITS:[7852397] [9880484][11371200]|. While the purpose of this shunt is yet unknown, it has been suggested that it may provide a mechanism for regulating |FRAME: MET| levels <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [11371200]|.

COMMENT - <b>General information</b>: Choline is a fundamental metabolite in plants because of its contribution to the synthesis 
/of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, which accounts for 40 to 60% of lipids in non-plastid plant membranes 
/|CITS: [12215503]|. Choline is also a precursor for the formation of glycine betaine (|FRAME:PWY1F-353|) in certain 
/plants such as spinach, where this osmoprotectant is accumulated and confers also tolerance to salinity, drought, and 
/other environmental stresses. In addition choline has been recognized as an essential nutrient for humans |CITS: [11481443]|.
/
/The choline biosynthetic pathway enables plants to decouple choline synthesis from lipid metabolism (Kennedy pathway - 
/|FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|) and provides them with the metabolic flexibility to adapt to environmental conditions where
/large and variable amounts of choline are beneficial for survival |CITS: [11461929]|.
/
/<b>Pathway information</b>: The first step in choline biosynthesis is the direct decarboxylation of serine to ethanolamine 
/|CITS: [11461929]|, which is catalyzed by a serine decarboxylase unique to plants |CITS: [14634155]|. Ethanolamine is
/widely recognized as the entrance compound to choline biosynthesis. 
/
/The pathway variant displayed (nucleotide pathway) represents the biosynthetic route as found in diverse plant families. 
/The synthesis of choline from ethanolamine may take place at three parallel pathways, where three consecutive 
/N-methylation steps are carried out either on free-bases |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92A]|, phospho-bases |CITS: [10799484]|, 
/phosphatidyl-bases |CITS: [11481443]| or a mixture of the latter |CITS: [Datko88a]| |CITS: [Datko88b]| |CITS: [Hitz81]|. 
/
/The synthesis of intermediates on both the phospho-base and phosphatidyl-base level includes the nucleotide pathway 
/via CDP-phosphoaminoalcohol and the methylation pathway. However, it has been pointed out that the synthesis of 
/phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine is characterized by a high degree of interaction and furcation on 
/the various levels of arising intermediates. Consequently, it has been assumed that the reactions embedded in the nucleotide
/and methylation pathways may be two characteristics of one overall phosphoaminoalcohol pathway for the formation of 
/phosphatidylcholine in plants |CITS: [Kinney93]|.
/
/The release of choline from the different pathway levels is also species-specific. Phosphocholine can either be directly 
/dephosphorylated to release choline as observed in spinach |CITS: [12232019]| or incorporated into phosphatidylcholine 
/with the subsequent release of choline, as in tobacco |CITS: [10806254]|. The latter reaction has been shown to be 
/specifically catalyzed by phospholipase D (|FRAME:LIPASYN-PWY|) in castor bean |CITS: [8051126]|. Although a 
/well-defined physiological role of phospholipase D (PLD) still await further research, progress has been made to assign 
/some members of the heterogeneous  family of PLD's to distinct cellular functions |CITS: [Wang99]|. The remaining 
/enzymes involved in this pathway, phosphoaminoalcohol cytidylyltransferase and CDP-aminoalcohol phosphotransferase, 
/cover a broader spectrum of substrates. This may be beneficial to process the heterogeneous mixture of possible 
/substrates but it also indicates that the pathway flux is probably controlled more upstream |CITS: [Kinney93]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| in an irreversible reaction.
/Five members of this family are known at present, including the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY "pyruvate dehydrogenase complex"| (PDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5084 "2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex"| (OGDHC), the |FRAME: PWY-5046 "branched-chain &alpha;-keto acid dehydrogenase complex"| (BCDHC), the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY "glycine cleavage complex"| (GDHC - this pathway), and the |FRAME: CPLX-7659| (ADHC). They all function at strategic points in (usually aerobic) catabolic pathways and are subject to stringent control |CITS: [9655933]|.
/
/With the exception of GDHC, the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes share a common structure. They consist of three main components, namely a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3).
/In Gram-positive bacteria and mitochondria, the E1 component is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, while in Gram-negative bacteria it is made of a single type of subunit.
/
/In all cases described so far, many copies of each subunit assemble to form the full complex. For example, the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1, E2, and E3 components, respectively.
/The core of the complex is made of either 24 (Gram-negative bacteria) or 60 (mitochondria) E2 units, which contain the lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as binding sites for the other two subunits. E1, which contains a |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| cofactor, catalyzes the binding of the 2-oxo acid to the lipoyl group of E2, which then transfers an acyl group (the nature of the acyl group depends on the particular enzyme) to |FRAME: CO-A|, forming an acyl-CoA. During this transfer, the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. E3 then transfers the protons to NAD, forming NADH and restoring the dihydrolipoyllysine group back to lipoyllysine.
/
/Cryoelectron microscopy of PDHC from |FRAME: TAX-1422| |CITS:[12411477]| and ox kidney |CITS: [11752427]| has revealed that the E2 inner core is surrounded by an outer shell of E1 and E3 components, with the lipoyl domains confined to the annular space between them where they must make successive journeys between the three types of active sites (E1-E3), which are physically far apart |CITS: [12795594]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In eukaryotes the mitochondrial glycine cleavage complex (glycine decarboxylase complex) is a loosely-associated multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of glycine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and a methylene group, in a multistep reaction (in |CITS: [15791207]|).  The methylene group, carried by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF|, enters cellular one-carbon metabolism. In mammals, it is the primary pathway for glycine catabolism |CITS: [6402507]|.
/
/The glycine cleavage complex is composed of four different proteins: the P-protein (|FRAME: EC-1.4.4.2|); the T-protein (|FRAME: EC-2.1.2.10|); the L-protein (|FRAME: EC-1.8.1.4|); and the H-protein (lipoyl-carrier protein, a non-enzyme that contains a lipoyl group that interacts successively with the three other components of the complex during the enzymatic reactions.
/The L-protein (also known as the E3 component) also participates in the |FRAME: PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|, the |FRAME: PWY-5084|, and the |FRAME: PWY-5046| multienzyme systems.
/
/In plants, this complex is known as the |FRAME: GLYCINEDECARBOXYLASE| complex and functions in |FRAME: PWY-181 photorespiration|. Its components from the mitochondria of |FRAME:TAX-3888| (pea) leaf have been extensively studied |CITS: [3080433]| and reviewed in |CITS: [11286922]|. In vertebrates, the components of the |FRAME: CPLX-7302| from |FRAME:TAX-9031| (chicken) have been well studied |CITS: [1993704][1526969][1993703]|.   
/
/The glycine cleavage complex is also present in bacteria as shown here for the |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: GCVMULTI-CPLX| |CITS: [11495998]|. In addition, components of the glycine cleavage complex have been characterized in archaea including the T-protein from |FRAME:TAX-53953| |CITS: [15272174]| and the L-protein from halophilic archaebacteria |CITS: [6426463] [8655478]| (although the role of the L-protein in glycine metabolism in halophiles is unclear |CITS: [8655478]|). In yeast, studies have been done on the regulation of genes encoding components of the glycine cleavage complex |CITS: [12702322]|.
/
/In humans, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia results from deficiency-causing mutations in the genes encoding P-protein, or T-protein. This autosomal recessively inherited disorder results in accumulation of large amounts of glycine in body fluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, causing severe neurological symptoms |CITS: [16450403]| and in |CITS: [16051266]|.  Mutations in gene DLD that encodes L-protein can result in lipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, a disease with multiple physiological symptoms and significant morbidity |CITS: [9934985]|.
/
/Crystal structures of the components of the glycine cleavage complex have been determined from plant, animal, and bacterial sources. References include: P-protein |CITS: [15791207]|, T-protein |CITS: [15272174] [16051266]|, L-protein |CITS: [10806386]|, and H-protein |CITS: [10806386]|. 
/
/The reactions of the glycine cleavage complex are reversible, and also provide a route for glycine biosynthesis (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: GLYCINE-SYN2-PWY|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In plants, a large amount of the cell-wall biomass is derived from the precursor UDP-glucuronate (UDP-GlcA) through the complex interconversion of nucleotide sugars (for review see |CITS:[15134748]|).  UDP-GlcA is converted to a number of other sugars including UDP-galacturonate, UDP-xylose and UDP-arabinose.  UDP-GlcA is synthesized in plants via two independent routes.  The more predominant route involves the direct oxidation of UDP-glucose by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (see |FRAME:UGD-RXN|).  A second pathway (this pathway) however has been described in plants and relies on the oxygenation of <i>myo</i>-inositol.  Free <i>myo</i>-inositol is synthesized from glucose-6-phosphate, phytate or acquired from exogenous sources.
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>  Within the inositol oxygenase pathway, <i>myo</i>-inositol is converted into free GlcA by <i>myo</i>-inositol oxygenase (MIOX, EC 1.13.99.1).  This enzyme is a key committing step in the pathway as it catalyzes the thermodynamically irreversible oxygenative cleavage of <i>myo</i>-inositol to GlcA.  The second step of the pathway involves the conversion of GlcA into GlcA 1-phosphate.  This reaction is catalyzed by a glucuronokinase in the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.  This catalytic activity has been reported in several plants (for example, <i>Zea mays</i>, <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, and <i>Glycine max</i> |CITS:[DICKINSON82]|). It was first characterized in more detail only in <i>Phaseolus aureus</i> and <i>Lilium longifolium</i> |CITS:[192151],[13661996]|, but work on the latter enzyme eventually allowed for the identification of a full-length functional |FRAME: AT3G01640-MONOMER| in |FRAME:ORG-5993| |CITS: [19951951]|. The last step of the pathway is catalyzed by enzymes with UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphate activity.  One enzyme partially purified from barley seedlings was shown to catalyze the conversion of GlcA 1-phosphate into UDP-GlcA |CITS:[5570433]|.  The study of this enzyme suggested that the production of UDP-GlcA from <i>myo</i>-inositol might be the predominant route in young barley seedlings.  A second enzyme isolated from pea sprouts was also shown to catalyze this reaction.  Interestingly, this enzyme was able to convert a wide range of monosaccharides 1-phosphate to their activated UDP-sugar form.  This enzyme was postulated to be involved in the formation of UDP-sugars at the end of salvage pathways in higher plants |CITS:[15326166]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is produced exclusively in microorganisms and plants and has to be taken up by humans through their diet. In addition, a large amount of riboflavin is manufactured biotechnically to satisfy the need for this vitamin in human and animal nutrition and as a food colorant |CITS:[16010344]|. Riboflavin is the precursor for the flavocoenzymes FMN and FAD which constitute essential cofactors in crucial life processes in all organisms such as electron transport, photosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation and vitamin metabolism |CITS:[16183635]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The biosynthesis of riboflavin is fed by two branches and is built from one molecule of GTP and two molecules of ribulose 5-phosphate. The first committed step in the pathway is catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II which is a bifunctional enzyme also expressing 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase activity. Therefore the enzyme catalyzes the first steps in both branches, i.e. the formation of the pyrimidine and of the carbohydrate from GTP and ribulose-5-phosphate, respectively |CITS:[7642114]| |CITS:[10783978]|. 
/
/The deamination of the reaction product 2,5-diamino-6-ribosylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5'-phosphate to form 5-amino-6-ribosylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5'-phosphate is carried out by diaminohydroxyphosphoribosylaminopyrimidine deaminase which activity has been demonstrated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[15208317]|. The further metabolization to 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione occurs by the consecutive action of a reductase and a phosphatase which both have not yet been identified in Arabidopsis. The condensation of that pyrimidine derivative with 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate (from the ribulose 5-phosphate branch) to afford 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine is carried out by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL) synthase |CITS:[10419541]|, an enzyme with a complex structure of 60 identical 16.5-kDa subunits |CITS:[10595538]|.
/
/The following dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine to form riboflavin is catalyzed by riboflavin synthase. The dismutation side-product 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione is than recycled and fed back to the riboflavin biosynthetic route |CITS:[15927885]|.
/
/Beyond the scope of riboflavin biosynthesis the formation of the flavocoenzymes FMN and FAD is catalyzed by two phosphotransferases, i.e. riboflavin kinase and FMN adenylyltransferase, respectively. The former enzyme has been identified and characterized in Arabidopsis actually demonstrating the bifunctional nature of the enzyme as riboflavin synthase/FMN hydrolase |CITS:[16183635]|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales, 
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family. 
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many 
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard.
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan 
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on 
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different glucosinolates, 
/of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine (range from homomethionine 
/to hexahomomethionine) (compare |FRAME:PWYQT-4450 aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, side chain elongation cycle|). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among 
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-8186 Umbelliferone| is a coumarin found in all higher plants and an important intermediate in the synthesis of more complex derivatives, such as poly-hydroxylated/methoxylated/prenylated coumarins, furanocoumarins and pyranocoumarins |CITS: [Bourgaud06]|.
/
/Early tracer experiments performed with |FRAME: TAX-286619 "<i>Anthoxanthum nitens</i> (vanilla grass)"| and |FRAME: TAX-47083| |CITS: [13805037][Ellis71]| and with |FRAME: TAX-39329 "<i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> (lavender)"| |CITS: [13873722]| showed that |FRAME: CPD-674 cinnamate| is incorporated into coumarin and 7-hydroxycoumarins and that <i>para</i>-hydroxylation was a prerequisite for <i>ortho</i>-hydroxylation. These observations lead to proposing that |FRAME: CPD-8186| is formed after the <i>ortho</i>-hydroxylation of |FRAME: COUMARATE| that leads to synthesis of |FRAME: CPD-14005|, and that the latter is subsequently transformed into umbelliferone by the spontaneous closure of the lactone ring, which occurs under acidic or neutral conditions (reviewed in |CITS: [Bourgaud06]|).
/
/|FRAME: MONOMER-17096|, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme that catalyzes this hydroxylation, was identified much later from the common rue, |FRAME: TAX-37565| |CITS: [22168819]|. The purified enzyme could not accept |FRAME: COUMARATE|, but catalyzed the hydroxylation of the activated form |FRAME: P-COUMAROYL-COA|, producing |FRAME: CPD-14005| which undergoes spontaneous lactonization to form |FRAME: CPD-8186|.
/
/The same enzyme can also hydroxylate |FRAME: CPD-13328|, forming |FRAME: CPD-13328| that lactonizes spontaneously to form |FRAME: SCOPOLETIN| |CITS: [22168819]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6792|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i> (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.
/
/Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Studies with the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| showed that uracil salvage is necessary for early development |CITS: [19563437]| and that uridine salvage plays a crucial role in photoassimilate allocation and partioning |CITS: [21828290]|. The inability to salvage uracil caused a light-dependent dramatic pale-green to albino phenotype, dwarfism and the inability to produce viable progeny in loss-of-function mutants |CITS: [19563437]|. In mammals it is generally accepted that only the liver and kidney maintain <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine and purine synthesis, and supply other tissues and organs, including the brain, with pyrimidine nucleosides (mainly uridine) and purine nucleosides and bases for nucleotide synthesis |CITS: [11782482][15772079][16769123]|. 
/
/Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well  documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The key enzyme in the salvage of the pyrimidine nucleobase |FRAME: URACIL| is uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) (|FRAME: EC-2.4.2.9 "EC 2.4.2.9"|), which transfers a phosphoribosyl group from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to uracil, generating |FRAME: UMP| in a single step. The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants |CITS: [16660311][216696][2189783][8856065][11773618][14658380]|. This pathway was shown to be the major route for uracil salvage in potato tubers |CITS: [12244448]|.
/
/Mammals lack the enzyme, and thereby are unable to perform the one-step salvage of uracil |CITS: [15685165]| and are limited to recycling pyrimidine nucleosides via uridine kinases (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|).
/
/Some archaea, bacteria and lower eukaryotes that possess the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7932| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 "EC 3.5.4.1"|) are also able to salvage exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by converting it to |FRAME: URACIL| (see |FRAME: PWY-7194|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13354| is an important pharmaceutical compound isolated from Rhodiola species. These species are mainly found in alpine regions of Asia and Scandinavia. |FRAME: CPD-13354| is an adaptogen with medicinal properties such as anti-fatigue, anti-senescence and anti-radiation effects. Natural habitats are limiting for its continuous supply and the cultivation of this plant requires 4-5 years, therefore, alternate ways to produce salidroside have been explored using in vitro studies. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13354| is a  phenylethanoid glycoside and is derived from phenylalanine or |FRAME: TYR|. Over expression of PAL gene did not increase |FRAME: CPD-13354| production as shown in this study |CITS: [18426479 ]|. |FRAME: CPD-13354| production, using |FRAME: TAX-265354| hairy roots induced by Agrobacterium rhizogenes gave promising yields.  The optimal concentration of the precursors; |FRAME: CPD3O-4151|, phenylalanine and |FRAME: TYR| along with elicitor concentration was established in this study |CITS: [17329834]|. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13354| is mainly found in the roots. The glycosylation of |FRAME: CPD3O-4151| is the final step of the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-13354|, the glycosyltransferases responsible for salidroside biosynthesis have been isolated |CITS: [21497865]| and |CITS: [17333022]|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD3O-4151| was worked out latter; its precursor was thought to be |FRAME: TYRAMINE|, which is synthesized from |FRAME: TYR|. The isolation and over expression of a tyrosine decarboxylase resulted in the increase in |FRAME: CPD3O-4151| and |FRAME: CPD-13354| production, indicating its role in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-13354| |CITS: [21538102]|. Further, in this study |CITS: [15227984]| it has been shown that red light promotes |FRAME: CPD-13354| production but decreases the plant biomass.

COMMENT - Polyamine hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates (polyamine phenylpropanoid conjugates) belong to the larger group of hydroxycinnamic acid amides. Polyamine conjugates have been identified in flowers of many plant species. Their exact role has not been proved. They may offer pollen grains protection against environmental stresses such as UV irradiation as well as pathogen attack. The accumulation of polyamine conjugates in pollen has also been associated with fertility. Dihydroxyferuloyl-sinapoyl spermidine is the predominant polyamine conjugate found in Arabidopsis flowers buds |CITS: [19077165]|. The biosynthetic pathway leading to this spermidine conjugate has only been proposed recently. Biochemical and genetic data demonstrated the involvement of a spermidine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (SHT), an O-methyltransferase (TSM1), and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP98A8). Similar gene expression profiles were found for SHT, TSM1 and CYP98A8.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This superpathway illustrates the universal <i>do novo</i> biosynthetic route for producing pyrimidine ribonucleotides (|FRAME: CDP| and |FRAME: UDP|), and the most common route in which these ribonucleotides are converted to the deoxyribonucleotides, including the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP|. This pathway is universal, and is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, |FRAME: UMP|, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to |FRAME: UDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DUDP|. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed <i>de novo</i>, |FRAME: CTP|, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to |FRAME: CDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DCDP|.
/
/Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase"| (EC 2.1.1.45).
/The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, |FRAME: DUDP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form. This is done in two steps - phosphorylation to |FRAME: DUTP|, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|. The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: HS11384-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: CPLX66-1052|.
/
/In organisms that contain the enzyme |FRAME: DCTP-DEAM-CPLX| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 EC 3.5.4.13"|), a second route forms |FRAME: DUMP| from |FRAME: DCDP|. |FRAME: DCDP| is phosphorylated to |FRAME: DCTP|, followed by deamination to |FRAME: DUTP| and hydrolysis to |FRAME: DUMP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7187|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:CPD-15477 Salvigenin| is a flavonoid found in sweet basil (|FRAME: TAX-39350|) and numerous other plant species |CITS: [20804824][  21893325][22923679]|. Flavonoids are found throughout the plant kingdom where they play diverse and important physiological roles |CITS: [21880658]|. Many of these structurally diverse compounds also have an impact on human health and the enzymes involved in their production are attractive candidates for metabolic engineering |CITS: [21732240]|. Notably, |FRAME: CPD-15477| has neuroprotective effects, likely due to its antioxidant activity |CITS: [22899171]|.
/
/Flavone metabolism in basil appears to occur in complex manner. While |FRAME: CPD-431| appears to be a general precursor of this pathway multiple routes with varying orders of hydroxylation and methylation seem to be involved in the production of  |FRAME: CPD-15477| |CITS: [23184958]|. A similar pattern is found in the downstream |FRAME: PWY-7298| pathway |CITS: [23747095]|. Both of these pathways take place in the peltate trichomes on basil leaves |CITS:[23184958][GRAYER96]|.
/
/The pathway has been delineated based on the experimental approach of integrating biochemical, metabolic and transcript data which provide insights into substrate preferences for the various <i>O</i>-methyltransferases and metabolite fluxes within the metabolic network of |FRAME:PWY-7325|.  The occurrence and availability of accumulating intermediates (|FRAME:CPD-15486|, |FRAME:CPD-15631|, |FRAME:CPD-15632|, |FRAME:CPD-16765| and |FRAME:CPD-15477|) and key compounds such as |FRAME:CPD-431| and |FRAME:CPD-15630| obtained from metabolite profiles in connection with substrate affinities of 7-<i>O</i> (FOMT1+2), 6-<i>O</i> (FOMT4+6), and 4'-<i>O</i>-methyltransferases (FOMT3+5) directs the order of the metabolite decoration with methyl and hydroxyl groups in this pathway and indicates the most favorable biosynthetic route |CITS:[22923679]|.

CITATIONS - 12242396
CITATIONS - 2077690:EV-EXP-TAS:3357327682:caspi
COMMENT - Tetrapyrroles are compounds whose molecules have four rings of the pyrrole type, generally linked
/together by single-atom bridges between the alpha positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings.
/Tetrapyrroles function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments,
/such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.
/The biosynthesis of all of these cofactors start in a similar manner, with the production of the
/intermediate |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|. This intermediate is an important branch point:
/its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or cofactor F430 synthesis,
/while decarboxylation directs it toward the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll |CITS: [14633982]|. 
/
/The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway shown here, which starts with glutamate, is found in plants,
/many bacteria (including <i>Escherichia coli</i>), and the archaea.
/A second tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, which is found in animals, fungi, certain protozoans,
/and members of the &alpha;-proteobacteria, starts with glycine and succinyl-coA (see
/|FRAME:PWY-5189|). Interestingly, both pathways are present in the chloroplast-containing protozoan
/|FRAME: TAX-3039|.
/
/Regardless whether the starting point is glycine or glutamate, both pathways converge at the intermediate
/|FRAME: 5-AMINO-LEVULINATE| and proceed through the important intermediate
/|FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|, which is a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of
/different tetrapyrrole compounds, such as the corrinoid cobalamine
/(vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), the methanogenic coenzyme

COMMENT - <B>General Background</B>
/
/Sphingolipids are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic cells. They are composed of a long-chain 
/base (amino alcohol), an amide linked fatty acyl chain, and a polar head. The predominant long-chain 
/bases in plants are C18 amino alcohols, with sphinganine, 4-hydroxysphinganine, and 
/4-hydroxy-8-sphingenine being the prevalent long-chain bases. Whilst, the prevalent long-chain bases 
/of many mammalian sphingolipids, sphingosine (4-sphingenine), is found only in trace amounts in 
/plants. The predominant fatty acyl chains in plants are alpha-hydroxy fatty acids, with saturated C22 to 
/C26 hydroxy fatty acyl chains, especially 2-hydroxylignoceric acid, are the most common ones. 
/Ceramide (without a polar head group), glucosylceramide, and derivatives of inositolphosphorylceramide 
/are the predominant plant sphingolipids. Sphingomyelin, which has phosphocholine as the polar head 
/group and is the major phosphosphingolipid in animals, has not been detected in plants. On the other 
/hand, yeast contains exclusively inositolphosphorylceramides.
/
/Species- and tissue-specific diversity of the long-chain base and fatty acyl chain exists in plant 
/glucosylceramides. In general, seed glucosylceramides are enriched with dihydroxy long-chain bases 
/and C16 to C20 saturated hydroxy fatty acids. In contrast, leaves are enriched with trihydroxy long-chain 
/bases and very long-chain (C20 to C26) saturated and monoenoic hydroxy fatty acids. Monoenoic 
/hydroxyl fatty acids are predominantly found in glucosylceramides from cold hardy crops and 
/Arabidopsis.
/
/It is estimated that sphingolipids account for up to 10% of total lipids in plants. Glucosylceramide is the 
/major sphingolipid. It is a significant lipid component of the plant cell plasma and tonoplast. While our 
/knowledge of sphingolipid functions are mainly learned from studies in mammals and yeast, plant 
/sphingolipids are thought to serve as membrane structural components and signal molecules.  
/
/
/<B>About This Pathway</B>
/
/Two mechanisms were shown for ceramide formation via condensation of a fatty acyl group with the 
/amino group of a long chain base. One utilizes acyl-CoAs and is catalyzed by sphinganine 
/N-acyltransferase, the other uses free fatty acids by ceramide synthase. The sphinganine 
/N-acyltransferase route is most likely the major route in plants. The relative activity of sphinganine 
/N-acyltransferase using acyl-CoA of varying chain length from 16 to 24 carbons parallel the distribution 
/of fatty acyl chains in glucosylceramides from different plant sources |CITS: [Lynch00]|. It suggests that 
/sphinganine N-acyltransferase plays a key role in determining the respective acyl chain composition 
/of naturally occurring plant glucosylceramides. 
/
/Although hydroxylation of the long chain base can occur with free sphinganine, hydroxylation and 
/desaturation of long chain bases, as well as alpha-hydroxylation of fatty acyl chains, occur 
/primarily after the formation of ceramides.

COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>  At the time of this review, 136 fully characterized gibberellins (starting with GA<sub>1</sub> |CITS:[5638147]|) have been identified in more than a hundred vascular plant species, seven bacteria and seven fungi |CITS:[SPONSEL04],[11986764]|.  Of these gibberellins only a few have biological activity.  Many of the GAs identified early in the history of the discovery of these hormones are the ones which possess the highest biological activity.  These include GA<sub>1</sub>, GA<sub>3</sub>, GA<sub>4</sub>, GA<sub>5</sub>, GA<sub>6</sub> and GA<sub>7</sub>.  GA<sub>1</sub> is the most active GA for stem elongation in <i>Zea mays</i> and <i>Pisum sativum</i>, while GA<sub>4</sub> is the most active GA in Cucurbitaceae and in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> (gibberellic acid), on the other hand, has been identified in more than 40 plants and is the major GA in the fungus <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  GA<sub>3</sub> is used commercially to promote seed germination, stem elongation and fruit growth.  In <i>Lolium</i>, GA<sub>5</sub> and GA<sub>6</sub> have been shown to enhance flowering, whilst GA<sub>1</sub> and GA<sub>4</sub> enhanced stem elongation |CITS:[12475622]|.
/
/Gibberellins are diterpenes which, in higher plants, are synthesized in the plastids from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate <i>via</i> the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).  They all have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME:C20SKELETON| and |FRAME:C19SKELETON|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C20SKELETON|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME:C19SKELETON|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.  C<sub>20</sub>-GAs do not usually have biological activity but can be metabolized to active C<sub>19</sub>-GAs (note that not all C<sub>19</sub>-GAs are bioactive).
/
/Gibberellins are believed to be synthesized in young tissues of the shoot and also the developing seed.  It is uncertain whether young root tissues also produce gibberellins.  There is also some evidence that leaves may be the source of some biosynthesis.
/
/Active gibberellins show many physiological effects, each depending on the type of gibberellin present as well as the species of plant.  Some of the physiological processes stimulated by gibberellins are: i) stimulation of stem elongation by stimulating cell division and elongation, ii) stimulation of bolting/flowering in response to long days, iii) interruption of seed dormancy in plants requiring stratification or light to induce germination, iv) stimulation of enzyme production (&alpha;-amylases) in germinating cereal grains for mobilization of seed reserves, v) induction of maleness in dioecious flowers (sex expression), vi) parthenocarpic (seedless) fruit development, and vii) delay of senescence in leaves and citrus fruits.

/Certain commercial chemicals which are used to stunt growth do so in part because they block the synthesis of gibberellins.  Some of these chemicals are |FRAME:CPD-6966|, |FRAME:CPD-6967|, |FRAME:CPD-6968|,  ancymidol and |FRAME:CPD-6970| (more inhibitors of GA biosynthesis can be found in |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|).  During active growth, the plant will maintain giberellin homeostasis by metabolizing most gibberellins by rapid hydroxylation to inactive conjugates.  Active |FRAME:GIBBERELLIN| is degraded much slower which helps to explain the symptoms observed in the disease bakanae caused by the rice pathogen <i>Gibberella fujikuroi</i>.  This pathogen produces large amounts of GA<sub>3</sub> which it secretes.  Inactive conjugates might be stored or translocated via the phloem and xylem before their release (activation) at the proper time and in the proper tissue.
/
/<b>This pathways:</b>  GA<sub>12</sub>, the first true gibberellin is synthesized in plastids (see |FRAME:PWY-5034|).  It is then further oxidized in the cytosol to a wide range of gibberellins.  Depending on the sequence of hydroxylation at the 3&beta;- and 13-positions, parallel pathways branch from GA<sub>12</sub> to the C<sub>19</sub>-GAs, the number and prevalence of these branch pathways varying from species to species.  The presence of the non 3, 13-hydroxylation branch pathway (also known as late 3, 13-hydroxylation), a pathway originating from GA<sub>12</sub> and leading to the hydroxylated C<sub>19</sub> GA<sub>4</sub>  has been demonstrated in many species including rice, wheat and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[15075394],[16160850],[2236013]|.
/
/<b>Enzymes:</b>  The reactions of this pathway are catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.  The first enzyme, gibberellin 20-oxidase, catalyzes the removal of C-20, thereby forming the C<sub>19</sub>-skeleton in GA<sub>4</sub>.  This enzyme performs the sequential oxidation of C-20 to the alcohol and aldehyde, followed by the removal of the C atom through formation of the 4, 10-lactone ring.  The alcohol intermediate (GA<sub>15</sub>) must be in its open lactone form (free alcohol) to be catalyzed by the enzyme.  It is however extracted from plants in its closed &delta;-lactone form (|FRAME:CPD-6971|) which is no longer oxidized by GA20-oxidases.  Although it is not certain whether this form occurs naturally <i>in planta</i> or is an artifact of the extraction procedure, it is interesting to note that spinach cell-free extracts contain an enzyme able to catalyze the conversion of the &delta;-lactone form to its free alcohol form |CITS:[WARD97]|.  Additional oxidation reactions leading to the formation of growth-active GAs such as GA<sub>4</sub> are performed by gibberellin 3-oxidases which, depending on the species, are varyingly regiospecific |CITS:[SPONSEL04]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Folates represent key compounds involved in one-carbon metabolism including the biosynthesis of methionine, purines, thymidylate and panthotenate |CITS: [11337394]|. In general, tetrahydrofolates have a &gamma;-linked polyglutamyl tail with up to seven residues linked to the first glutamate which are subject to ongoing synthesis and turnover |CITS:[11960743]|. The polyglutamyl tail has been discussed as critical pre-condition for enzyme activity; whereas in contrast to that most carriers prefer monoglutamates |CITS:[11310973]|
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: There are two enzymes involved in this pathway, the folylpolyglutamate synthase that catalyzes the conversion of folates to polyglutamates and the &gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase (also referred to as pteroyl-&gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase that catalyzes the opposite reaction. 
/Both folypolylglutamate synthase and &gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase exist in Arabidopsis as small gene families. 
/
/Three cDNA's encoded for folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity (FPGS) but did not exhibit any dihydrofolate synthetase activity (DHFS). The FPGS in generating the polyglutamylated isoforms prevent the transport of unconjugated tetrahydrofolates and process their cell-compartment-dependent biosynthesis |CITS: [11752472]|. The &gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase has been shown to exist in Arabidopsis in a small family of genes that are tandemly arranged on chromosome 1. Two out of those three genes encoding for the hydrolase have been recombinant expressed and partially characterized in <i>E. coli</i>. They differ in terms of their cleavage pattern indicating that they may complement each other in hydrolyzing the polyglutamyl tail <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:[15961386]|. 
/It is also interesting to notice the finding that folate deglutamylation may occur extracellularly in plants although the physiological meaning remains to be determined |CITS:[8912628]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: TAX-4932 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>| can biosynthesize |FRAME: GLY glycine| via three different pathways.
/
/When the cells are grown with glucose as the carbon source, two alternative pathways operate. 
/In one pathway |FRAME:ENZRXN-13666 L-threonine aldolase|, encoded by |FRAME: G-9836 GLY1|, produces glycine from
/|FRAME:THR L-threonine| (which is produced from the glycolytic intermediate oxaloacetate) (see
/|FRAME: GLYSYN-THR-PWY glycine biosynthesis IV|). In the other pathway glycine is formed from |FRAME:SER L-serine| (a product of
/|FRAME: G3P 3-phospho-D-glycerate|, another glycolytic intermediate) via two serine hydroxymethyltransferases - a cytosolic
/enzyme (SHMT2) and a mitochondrial enzyme (SHMT1)
/(see |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY glycine biosynthesis I|).  The two isoforms are reported to work in opposite directions,
/depending on the culture conditions |CITS: [9398220]|.
/
/When the cells are grown with a non-fermentable carbon source, such as |FRAME:ETOH ethanol| and
/|FRAME:ACET acetate|, glycine is produced from |FRAME: GLYOX glyoxylate|, a product of the
/|FRAME: GLYOXYLATE-BYPASS glyoxylate cycle|, by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX-7560 alanine--glyoxylate aminotransferase 1| (see
/|FRAME: GLYSYN-ALA-PWY glycine biosynthesis III|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This single reaction pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: GLYOHMETRANS-CPLX serine hydroxymethyltransferase|, is the major pathway
/for biosynthesis of |FRAME: GLY glycine| in |FRAME: TAX-83333 <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12|, and the main source for one carbon units,
/which are stored in the form of |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-4932 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>|, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT)
/isozymes are encoded by distinct nuclear genes (|FRAME: YBR263W SHM1| and |FRAME: YLR058C SHM2|).
/As in |FRAME:TAX-562 <i>Escherichia coli</i>|, SHMT is the major provider of not only |FRAME: GLY glycine|, but also of one-carbon units
/|CITS: [9398220]|.
/
/When yeast was grown on |FRAME: SER L-serine| as the primary one-carbon source, the cytoplasmic isozyme
/was the main provider of glycine and one-carbon groups for purine synthesis.
/When grown on |FRAME: GLY glycine|, the mitochondrial SHMT was the predominant isozyme catalyzing the
/synthesis of serine from glycine and one-carbon units. However, when both serine and glycine were
/present, the mitochondrial SHMT made a significant contribution of one-carbon units, but not glycine,
/for purine synthesis |CITS: [9398220]|.

COMMENT - Homomethionine is a non-protein amino acid. Homomethionine is synthesized from methionine via chain elongation. Transamination of methionine first forms a 2-oxo acid. The 2-oxo acid is then extended by one methyl group by a condensation reaction, an isomerization reaction, and a oxidative decarboxylation reaction. The newly formed 2-oxo acid can be transaminated to homomethionine or undergo further cycles of condensation, isomerization and oxidative decarboxylation to form di, tri, tetra, penta, and hexahomomethionines.  Mono, di, tri, tetra, penta, and hexahomomethionines are precursors for aliphatic glucosinolates biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. 
/
/The cytosolic recycled methionine (|FRAME: PWY-5041 <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine cycle II|), not the plastid-located de novo synthesized 
/methionine, is believed to be the substrate for methionine chain elongation and glucosinolate biosynthesis |CITS: [17056707]|. 
/First, the first enzyme in the chain elongation pathway, methionine-oxo-acid transaminase (AT-BCAT4), is
/ cytosolic. Second, the gene expressions of AT-BCAT4 and the two cytosolic methionine synthase, involved 
/in the SAM cycle, are strongly co-regulated.

COMMENT - Tryptamine is an important molecule in eukaryotes. In mammals, tryptamine is an endogenous neuroactive metabolite
/of tryptophan, with behavioral, physiological and pharmacological effects |CITS: [8098507]|.
/In plants, tryptamine is a merging point of primary and secondary metabolism.
/Tryptamine, which is derived from tryptophan by the action of |FRAME: MONOMER-7901 tryptophan decarboxylase|, provides the
/indole unit of monoterpenoid-indole and derived alkaloids, many of which are psychoactive
/|CITS: [8868227][9490777]|.
/Tryptophan decarboxylase has been cloned from |FRAME: TAX-4058 <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>|, and overexpressed in |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>|;
/it resulted in high tryptamine levels, and resistance to whitefly |CITS: [12228625]|.
/
/The pathway is widely spread in plants and fungi |CITS: [8868227]|, but little information is available
/about tryptamine in bacterial metabolism.
/
/Mitoma and Udenfriend |CITS: [14423022]| have demonstrated that strains of |FRAME:TAX-1351 <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>|
/possess tryptophan decarboxylase activity, transforming tryptophan to tryptamine. However, since their
/enzyme preparation also had tyrosine and phenylalanine decarboxylase activity, and taking into account the very
/high Km that enzyme had for tryptophan (13 mM) , they were not sure whether tryptophan decarboxylation in that
/organism was a result of a distinct enzyme or an activity of  aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28). 
/
/Perley and Stowe |CITS: [4960870]| demonstrated production of tryptamine from tryptophan by |FRAME:TAX-1396 <i>Bacillus cereus</i>|

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Arginase-mediated |FRAME: ARG L-arginine| degradation is widely distributed in the biosphere, and is found
/in all primary kingdoms |CITS: [8759304]|.  The first step in this process, catalyzed by the enzyme
/arginase, is the hydrolysis of |FRAME:ARG L-arginine| to form |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE L-ornithine| and |FRAME:UREA urea|.
/
/There are many variations of the arginase pathway, since the fate of the products of the arginase
/reaction may be different in different organisms. 
/Variants of arginase-based |FRAME: ARG L-arginine|-degradation pathways include |FRAME: ARGASEDEG-PWY arginine degradation I (arginase pathway)|,
/|FRAME:ARG-PRO-PWY arginine degradation VI (arginase 2 pathway)|, and |FRAME: ARG-GLU-PWY arginine degradation VII (arginase 3 pathway)|.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This variant is the "classical" arginase pathway, having the widest distribution.  The pathway
/is found in mammals as well as many bacteria. 
/In this pathway |FRAME:ARG L-arginine| is converted into |FRAME:GLT L-glutamate| in a series of three steps;
/following the initial step, catalyzed by arginase, |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE L-ornithine| is converted to
/|FRAME:L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE L-glutamate &gamma;-semialdehyde| by |FRAME:CPLX-6747 ornithine aminotransferase| (OAT). 
/|FRAME:L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE L-glutamate &gamma;-semialdehyde| undergoes a spontaneous conversion to
/|FRAME: L-DELTA1-PYRROLINE_5-CARBOXYLATE (<i>S</i>)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate|, which is then converted in the third step, catalyzed
/by |FRAME:CPLX-6746 &Delta;-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase|, to |FRAME:GLT L-glutamate|. 
/In a subsequent step glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) removes the amino group from |FRAME:GLT L-glutamate|,
/generating |FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE 2-oxoglutarate|, which is fed to the |FRAME:TCA TCA cycle|
/(see |FRAME: GLUTAMATE-DEG1-PWY glutamate degradation I|). 
/Such conversion into |FRAME:GLT L-glutamate| is a common route for the degradation of amino acids, including
/|FRAME:GLN L-glutamine|, |FRAME:HIS L-histidine|, and
/|FRAME:PRO L-proline| (see the pathways |FRAME: GLUTAMINDEG-PWY glutamine degradation I|, |FRAME: HISDEG-PWY histidine degradation I| and
/|FRAME: PROUT-PWY proline degradation|).
/
/In mammals, the enzymes catalyzing the reactions of this pathway are present in the mitochondrial matrix. 
/There are two isoforms of mammalian arginases - a mitochondrial form, including the humane |FRAME:CPLX-6622 arginase type 2|,
/and a cytosolic form, which includes the human |FRAME:CPLX-6621 arginase type 1|. 
/The cytosolic arginases, however, are believed to be involved mostly in the urea cycle (see
/|FRAME: PWY-4984 urea cycle|) |CITS: [6408859]|, although this notion has been questioned |CITS: [15050972]|. 
/Human arginases were found in many tissues, including kidney and prostate, brain,
/skeletal muscle, placenta, lung, mammary gland, macrophage, uterus, testis, and gut |CITS: [9256072]
/[15050972]|.
/
/In prokaryotes, this pathway is used for the catabolism of |FRAME: ARG L-arginine| as either a carbon or a
/nitrogen source.  Arginases have been detected in and characterized from several species,
/including bacilii |CITS: [2029528][7540694]|, agrobacteria |CITS: [3758074][3957872]|,
/cyanobacteria |CITS: [Gupta81][100070][10648527]|, <i>Proteus</i> spp. |CITS: [4579440]|,
/|FRAME: TAX-271 <i>Thermus aquaticus</i>| |CITS: [64178]|, and mycobacteria |CITS: [13192096]|.  However, in most of these
/cases the fate of |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE L-ornithine| is not known |CITS: [3534538]|. 
/In some cases |FRAME: ARG L-arginine| can can be utilized by the organism as both carbon and nitrogen source,
/while in others it is used only as a nitrogen source.  In addition, some organisms possess the enzyme
/urease, which converts the urea formed by arginase into |FRAME: CARBON-MONOXIDE carbon monoxide| and
/|FRAME: AMMONIA ammonia|, a favorite nitrogen source.
/
/In some strains, such as |FRAME: TAX-1402 <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i>|, the pathway is subject to strong catabolite repression during growth
/on glucose |CITS: [5674049]|.  In some strains, the pathway is also subject to nitrogen catabolite
/repression. Such regulation is species specific and is not universal |CITS: [6124533]|.
/
/Although this pathway was not originally believed to act in plants, later studies provided evidence for its existence |CITS: [18419821][18621980]|. For example, in |FRAME: TAX-3349 <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>| (Scots pine), this pathway appears to be required to provide the glutamate that is needed for glutamine biosynthesis during the early stages of seed germination |CITS: [18621980]|.  However, further work will be required to determine if this is the only pathway that operates in plants, or whether additional pathways such as |FRAME: ARG-PRO-PWY arginine degradation VI (arginase 2 pathway)| can also contribute to arginine degradation |CITS: [18419821][9576796]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The transition element molybdenum (Mo) has been long known as an essential micronutrient across
/the kingdoms of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. However, molybdate itself is catalytically 
/inactive and, with the exception of bacterial nitrogenase, needs to be activated through complexation
/by a special cofactor. This molybdenum cofactor (moco) consists of a unique tricyclic pterin compound
/(molybdopterin) containing a Mo-binding and -coordinating dithiolene group. Moco finally binds to diverse
/apoproteins and confers activity to the resulting holoproteins ubiquitously involved in essential redox
/reactions in the global C-, N-, and S-cycles |CITS: [11848841]| |CITS: [16307306]|.
/
/Although molybdenum enzymes are found in all organism kingdoms only four enzymes have been
/reported in plants so far |CITS: [12147719]|. However, the importance of those enzymes is highlighted
/by the fact that unavailability of Mo, hence failure to complement the apoproteins with moco is lethal
/for the organism. Moco enzymes in plants are subdivided into two classes, |FRAME:CPLX-7198 assimilatory nitrate reductase (NADH)|
/|CITS: [3393528]| and |FRAME:CPLX-7196 sulfite oxidase| |CITS: [11598126]| originating from the dioxo-form of moco
/and |FRAME:CPLX-6985 xanthine dehydrogenase| |CITS: [14726515]| and |FRAME:CPLX-7097 aldehyde oxidase / indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase / abscisic aldehyde oxidase| |CITS: [11050171]| that require
/the addition of a terminal inorganic sulfur to the Mo center (sulfo-form of moco) for enzymatic activity.
/
/The chemical nature and biosynthesis of moco has been investigated in detail in bacteria, e.g.
/|CITS: [7836363][8514783][8514782][1587808][14761975]|.
/The group of R.R. Mendel (TU Braunschweig) has considerably contributed to the corresponding research
/in plants which results have been summarized in several excellent reviews |CITS: [16669776][16784786]
/[12147719][16234918][9421926]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Plant enzymes such as aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) depend on the
/sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (moco). The so called maturation of moco involves the addition of
/sulfur to the Mo center catalyzed by the moco sulfurase (ABA3) |CITS: [11553608][15561708]|.
/This enzyme again is a two-domain protein that generates an enzyme-bound persulfide intermediate
/(ABA3-NifS domain) whereas the C-terminal domain is probably involved in recognizing target enzymes
/and posttranslational activation of ABA3 |CITS: [11553608]|.
/However, whether the sulfuration of moco is carried out before or after the insertion into the apoenzyme
/remains to be investigated.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Stachyose and raffinose are two members of the so-called 'raffinose series' of sucrosyl oligosaccharides (also known as raffinose family oligosaccharides, RFOs).  Sucrosyl oligosaccharides represent a large portion of primary oligosaccharides in plants (defined as oligosaccharides synthesized by the action of a glycosyl transferase that mediates the transfer of a glycopyranosyl residue to either the glucopyranosyl or fructofuranosyl moiety of sucrose.  They are differentiated from secondary oligosaccharides which are generated by the hydrolysis of higher oligosaccharides, polysaccharides or heterosides.  For review, see |CITS:[KANDLER82]|).  Members of the raffinose series occur at least in traces in each plant family; it is one of the most widespread sucrosyl oligosaccharide series in flowering plants and might even be ubiquitous (see |CITS:[KANDLER82]| for review).  This series comprises |FRAME:CPD-1099|, |FRAME:CPD-170|, |FRAME:CPD-8065|,|FRAME:CPD-8066| (see also |FRAME:PWY-5342|) as well as several other compounds with a higher degree of polymerization (DP; the highest is a nonasaccharide; none of these higher-DP oligosaccharides in the series have not yet been named).  The sugars of this series consist of &alpha;1,6-linked chains of D-galactose attached to the 6-glucosyl position of sucrose.  They are synthesized in leaves, roots and tubers.  Raffinose is usually found in all parts of the plants including seeds, unless another sucrosyl oligosaccharide series prevails.  Stachyose is often the main oligosaccharide in storage organs although variations occur between species.  Functionally, these soluble carbohydrates are used for carbon transport and storage by the plant, although they have also been reported as possibly acting as protective agents during maturation of drying seeds |CITS:[HORBOWICZ94]| and during cold stress |CITS:[12223781],[11115899]|.  Sugars of this series have long been considered as undesirable non-digestible factors that promote flatulence.  Recently, however, it has been suggested that they might have beneficial effects on the gut microflora |CITS:[TORTUERO97]|.  Moreover, they have been suggested for non-food applications (organ preservation) |CITS:[11308150]|.
/
/<b>Enzymes of the pathway:</b>
/
/The first step of the biosynthesis starts with the formation of the unusual galactosyl donor |FRAME:CPD-458|.  The enzyme allowing the formation of this compound is galactinol synthase, which catalyzes the transfer of a galactosyl residue from UDP-galactose onto <i>myo</i>-inositol [UDP-galactose:<i>myo</i>-inositol (1-&alpha;-D) galactosyltransferase].  Several enzymes with this activity have been characterized and purified.  The only known function of galactinol is in the biosynthesis of RFOs; it has therefore been postulated that galactinol synthase might be the committed and regulatory step for the synthesis of these compounds.  The following step consists in the transfer of galactosyl units from galactinol to sucrose to form raffinose, the first RFO of the series.  The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is known as raffinose synthase (galactinol:sucrose 6-galactosyltransferase).  Stachyose is formed by the additional incorporation of a galactosyl unit to raffinose by a stachyose synthase (galactinol:raffinose 6-galactosyltransferase).

CITATIONS - 16531054:EV-EXP-IDA:3456758859:anuradha
COMMENT - This pathway produces the polyamine |FRAME: PUTRESCINE putrescine|. This metabolite like other polyamines is cationic and may be involved in interactions with proteins, DNA and RNA molecules. It particpates in the developmental and physiological functions as well as in aiding regulatory processes. In plants polyamines are also known to be stress molecules |CITS: [16531054]|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME: PUTRESCINE putrescine| in plants occurs via either the ornithine decarboxylase or arginine decarboxylase route, sometimes by both, unlike |FRAME: PUTRESCINE putrescine| biosynthesis in microbes, where either one of these routes are exclusively followed. The pathway depicted here is one where the two routes are connected in plants. In tobacco, |FRAME: PUTRESCINE putrescine| is a precursor of nicotine which is a powerful anti-herbivore toxin. Nicotine is induced by wounding or by elicitation by methyljasmonate treatment. The enzymes of this pathway are recruited during stress and characterized by high transcript accumulation during the stress periods |CITS: [15322128]|.
/
/Polyamines also accumulate in plant organs as conjugates of hydrocinnamate, formed by an amide bond. The polyamines are stored in organs in any one predominant form of the conjugated |FRAME: PUTRESCINE putrescine| |CITS: [8660289]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of UMP appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways
/as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. The pathway converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|,
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (UMP), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: UMPKI-CPLX| catalyzes the phosphorylation of UMP to form UDP. The eukaryotic enzyme also catalyzes the phosphorylation of CMP to CDP, and was thus named |FRAME: AT5G26667-MONOMER| |CITS: [15604701]|.
/
/The penultimate enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (NDK), catalyzes a reaction in which the terminal phosphate of a nucleoside triphosphate is transferred to a nucleoside diphosphate - in this case, the
/transfer of a phosphate from the purine ATP to the pyrimidine UDP, forming UTP. The enzyme has a broad substrate specificity, and is involved in the biosynthesis of several nucleoside-triphosphates, including formation of CTP from CDP.
/
/Interconversion between thymidine and cytidine nucleotides is possible only at the level of nucleoside triphosphates, by the glutamine (or ammonia)-dependent enzyme |FRAME: CTPSYN-CPLX|.

COMMON-NAME - D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4)-trisphosphate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 3010126:EV-EXP-IDA:3464960272:caspi
COMMENT - |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate| is a secondary messenger molecule used in signal transduction and lipid signaling in eukaryotic cells.
/It mediates the biological response of a large number of hormones and neurotransmitters in target cells by regulating calcium release from intracellular stores.
/|FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate| is synthesized by hydrolysis of |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"| (PIP2), a phospholipid that is located in the plasma membrane, by the action of phospholipase C, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6351 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate biosynthesis|.
/
/Once formed, the levels of |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate| are tightly regulated by two mechanisms.
/
/In the first mechanism the compound is dephosphorylated to |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-BISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4)-bisphosphate| |CITS: [6285891][6095097]|, initiating a pathway that recycles the inositol moiety to the plasma membrane as posphatidylinositols (see |FRAME: PWY-6363 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate degradation|).
/
/In the second mechanism, which is described here, |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate| is phosphorylated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase to |FRAME: CPD-506 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate|. This compound has been suggested to have roles in controlling calcium homeostasis, transferring calcium between intracellular stores, and/or regulating calcium entry across the plasma membrane |CITS: [1659392]|. It may also play a role in regulating cross-talk between the calcium and other signaling pathways. A |FRAME: CPD-506 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate|-binding protein has been identified that can stimulate the GTPase activity of the ras and rap small GTP binding proteins |CITS: [7637787][9038348]|.
/
/In fungi and in plants |FRAME: CPD-506 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate| is phosphorylated further to |FRAME: CPD-1107 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate| and eventually |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE 1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate| |CITS: [2550825][2548474]|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6361 1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol hexakisphosphate biosynthesis I  (from Ins(1,4,5)P3)|.
/However, in mammals |FRAME: CPD-506 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate| is cleaved to |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-3-4-TRIPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4)-trisphosphate| |CITS: [3010126]|, and synthesis of |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE 1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate| proceeds from there, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6362 1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol hexakisphosphate biosynthesis II (mammalian)|.
/
/|FRAME: INOSITOL-1-3-4-TRIPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4)-trisphosphate| also acts as a link between the degree and duration of receptor-dependent phospholipase C activation (expressed as levels of |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate| and thus |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-3-4-TRIPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,3,4)-trisphosphate|) and the generation of other second messenger compounds such as |FRAME: INOSITOL-1456-TETRAKISPHOSPHATE D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate| and |FRAME: CPD-178 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (3,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate| (see |FRAME: PWY-6366 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (1,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate biosynthesis| and |FRAME: PWY-6365 D-<i>myo</i>-inositol (3,4,5,6)-tetrakisphosphate biosynthesis|).

TYPES - Chorismate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - chorismate biosynthesis from 3-dehydroquinate
CITATIONS - 3481024:EV-EXP:3579413299:dreher
COMMENT - <b>Background</b>
/
/In this pathway chorismate is synthesized from |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|. The pathway is found in prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea) and several eukaryotes, including ascomycete fungi, apicomplexans, plants and algae |CITS: [16963634]|. However, it's starting point, |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE|, can be synthesized in different routes. In most microorganisms it is synthesized from |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| (see |FRAME: PWY-6164|), but the methanogens of the |FRAME: TAX-28890| phylum utilize an alternative route |CITS: [15182204]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6160|). 
/
/|FRAME: CHORISMATE "Chorismate"| is an intermediate in the synthesis of the three aromatic amino acids: |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|. These amino acids serve as substrates in other pathways for secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, lignin, coumarin, indole derivatives and other phenolic compounds |CITS: [22296303]|. 
/
/|FRAME: SHIKIMATE "Shikimate"| is an important intermediate in the chorismate biosynthetic pathway. It was first isolated from Japanese star anise. Shikimate is used for the production of some antiviral drugs used to halt the spread of the flu virus, but as a biosynthetic intermediate, it is usually not found in high concentrations in organisms. Shikimate can be easily harvested from the needles of several species of pine trees, and biosynthetic pathways in <i>E. coli</i> have been enhanced to obtain sufficient amounts of the metabolite for commercial use.  
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHP synthase) catalyzes the condensation of |FRAME: PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: ERYTHROSE-4P| to form |FRAME: 3-DEOXY-D-ARABINO-HEPTULOSONATE-7-P| (DAHP). It is a crucial enzyme that controls flux through the chorismate pathway in plants |CITS: [22296303]|. Three different isoforms of the enzyme encoded by <i>aroF, aroG</i> and <i>aroH</i> are expressed in <i>E. coli</i> and these enzymes are subject to feedback inhibition by the aromatic amino acids produced |CITS: [4884590]|.
/
/|FRAME: AROB-MONOMER| catalyzes the transformation of DAHP to |FRAME: DEHYDROQUINATE| (DHQ). While this reaction requires NAD as a cofactor, there is no net use of NAD as the reaction regenerates it. |FRAME: AROD-CPLX| hydrolyzes DHQ to |FRAME: 3-DEHYDRO-SHIKIMATE| which is subsequently reduced to shikimate by |FRAME: AROE-MONOMER|. Shikimate kinase catalyzes the fifth reaction in chorismate biosynthesis. The kinase forms a complex with the bifunctional DAHP synthase-chorismate mutase enzyme. The complex may serve as a regulatory unit |CITS: [170268] [BSUB225]|.
/
/5-enolpyruvoylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase catalyzes the penultimate step in chorismate biosynthesis. The synthase is activated by ammonium ions and exhibits allosteric behavior. Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine) acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to PEP and as a partial uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to shikimate 3-P |CITS: [3111378] [7744055][7589547]|.
/
/Chorismate synthase acts in the shikimate pathway. It catalyses the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate into chorismate, the key branch-point intermediate in aromatic biosynthesis.

TYPES - Folate-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3277650456:pkarp
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis.
/Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|.
/
/Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons) of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.
/
/Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084][SCOTT00][KIRK94]|. In addition, in eukaryotic cells the glutamylated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|.
/
/The product of this pathway, |FRAME: THF tetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate| (tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate, H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>,
/THF), is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state
/of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions (see
/|FRAME: PWY-2201 folate transformations I|), and the number of conjugated glutamate residues  (see |FRAME: PWY-2161 folate polyglutamylation|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of folates is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants. 
/Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of a pterin, |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE 4-aminobenzoate| and |FRAME:GLT L-glutamate| moieties.
/The first two are synthesized from |FRAME:GTP GTP| and |FRAME:CHORISMATE chorismate|, respectively (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6147 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate biosynthesis I| for the biosynthesis of the former). The consecutive action of the FolK, FolP, FolC, and FolA enzymes finally produces the final product, |FRAME: THF tetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate| |CITS: [12039964]|.
/
/In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pABA (synthesized in plastids) in mitochondria followed by subsequent glutamylation and reduction steps which may take place in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743][11752472]|. The recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each of them encoded by a different gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least parts of the pathway can be carried out independently in those compartments.
/
/In addition to the <i>de novo</i> pathway, many organisms also possess salvage pathways that are used
/to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from breakdown products of folates in the cell, such as 5 or 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate.
/
/<b>About Folates In Animals</b>
/
/While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the <i>de novo</i> synthesis pathway, vertebrates are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF <i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate| (5-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) and |FRAME: 10-FORMYL-THF 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate mono-L-glutamate| (formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|.
/
/Polyglutamyl folates are hydrolyzed to folylmonoglutamates by |FRAME: HS06361-MONOMER &gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase|, and metabolized within the enterocyte into 5-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin |CITS: [13906633][2736319]|, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent |FRAME:ENZRXN-5465 folylpolyglutamate &gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase| to monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>).
/
/Insufficient supply of the vitamin in vertebrates leads to anemia in adults, and has been shown to cause neural tube malformation in human embryos |CITS: [11744531]|. In addition, folate defficiency has been linked to a number of other birth defects, several types of cancer, dementia, affective disorders, Down's syndrom, and serious conditions affecting pregnancy outcome (for a review, see |CITS: [11001804]|).

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX3O-118 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The thiamin biosynthesis pathway illustrated here has been most extensively studied in the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| and the plant |FRAME: ORG-5993|.
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-P "Thiamin phosphate"| is formed by the coupling of two moieties, the pyrimidine |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| and the thiazole |FRAME: THZ-P|, which are produced by two different pathways. In eukaryotes |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| is first dephosphorylated into|FRAME: THIAMINE|, which is diphosphorylated to |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|, the activive form of thiamin.
/
/The occurrence of thiamine triphosphate in plants has also been demonstrated; however the physiological function of that compound remains to be shown |CITS:[12943234]|.
/
/While many of the enzymes involved in eukaryotic thiamin biosynthesis have been identified, most of the enzymes have not been extensively characterized at a biochemical level. Moreover, several steps in the pathway require further clarification. For example, the source of the sulfur in thiazole has not been identified, and the gene encoding the putative TMP phosphatase has not been discovered.
/
/The subcellular compartmentalization of thiamin biosynthesis is also a subject of on-going investigation. The Arabidopsis proteins TH1, ThiC, and TH1 all localize to the chloroplasts |CITS:[18048325][18332905][17174261][11575719]|, but THI1 can also localize to the mitochondria |CITS:[11575719]|. The downstream TPK1 and TPK2 enzymes are both cytosolic in Arabidopsis |CITS:[17611796]|, suggesting that intermediates in the vitamin B1 biosynthesis pathway may need to be transported out of organelles for |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| synthesis to be completed. In addition,
/because TPP is used as a cofactor for enzymes present in different organelles, TPP transporters likely exist as well |CITS:[17611796]|.

COMMENT - The term |FRAME: Vitamin-E vitamin E| (tocochromenols) is a collective term for the eight forms of |FRAME: Tocotrienols tocotrienols| and |FRAME: Tocopherols tocopherols|, each existing as &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species.
/
/Structurally tocotrienols and tocopherols differ only in the degree of unsaturation of their side-chain. The tocotrienol chain comprises three <i>trans</i>-double bonds, whereas the tocopherol chain is fully saturated. In addition, the &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species of both compound groups vary in the methylation pattern of the chromanol ring |CITS:[12897790]|.
/
/The tocotrienols are mostly found in monocots |CITS:[Padley94]| and a few dicots |CITS:[17110122]| whereas tocopherols are wider spread in the plant kingdom and dominate in the dicots |CITS:[8827691]|. Tocotrienols are known as potent antioxidant and because of that have been appreciated for their nutritive value in human food and animal fodder |CITS:[8464850]|. Moreover, health-promoting assets of tocotrienols such as anticancer properties |CITS:[22095072]| made this compound group commercially interesting as nutraceuticals.
/
/The biosynthetic pathway of tocotrienols (this pathway) only differs in one step from the biosynthesis of tocopherols (see |FRAME:PWY-1422 vitamin E biosynthesis (tocopherols)|). The first committed step of the pathway catalyzed by the homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT) is characterized by the high acceptance of |FRAME:GERANYLGERANYL-PP geranylgeranyl diphosphate| over the similar |FRAME:PHYTYL-PYROPHOSPHATE phytyl diphosphate| which leads the way into tocopherol biosynthesis |CITS:[12897790] [21223386]|. All other enzymes after this step, i.e. tocopherol cyclases |CITS:[18810749] [23733887]| and tocopherol methyltransferases |CITS:[22763462]| can work with either one of the precursors and produce either tocotrienols, tocopherols or a mixture of both. This could also be demonstrated by introducing barley HGGT to species which do not produce tocotrienols, e.g. <i>Arabidopsis</i>, corn and tobacco. As a result of the transformation the transgenic plants produced predominantly tocotrienols and enhanced the overall production of vitamin E in those species |CITS:[12897790] [21223386] [18810749] [526275]|.

COMMENT - Flavonoids constitute an important group of plant secondary metabolite.  Over 10,000 flavonoids have been 
/described in the literature |CITS: [17587669]|. Flavonoids are known for their diverse bioactivities such as 
/antioxidants, plant defense agent, anticancer agent etc.  The structural diversity of flavonoids is attributed 
/to acylation, glycosylation and methylation of their hydroxyl groups. O-Methylation of flavonoids results in 
/a reduction of their reactivity and an increase in antimicrobial activity, whereas glycosylation increases their 
/solubility and stability |CITS: [18817819]|. O-Methylation of flavonoids is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases (OMTs).  
/They transfer the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to specific hydroxyl groups of flavonoids. Plant 
/OMTs are highly regioselective, i. e. they transfer the methyl group to a specific hydroxyl group in flavonoid |CITS: [18817819]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Avenacins are triterpene glucosides which act as phytoalexins and allelopathic agents conferring resistance against soil-borne pathogens and influencing the development of close neighbors |CITS:[10536024] [16995908]|. The occurrence of the phytoalexic avenacins appears to be restricted to the genus <i>Avena</i> which is an expression of a highly specialized defense biochemistry |CITS:[Hostettmann95]|. In general, triterpenes are valued compounds with a wide range of commercial applications and because of that in the focus of metabolic engineering. One of the major goals is to re-introduce lost traits of resistance into cultivated crops |CITS:[22639586]|.
/
/As a general rule genes in plant biochemical pathways, unlike bacterial biochemical pathways, have been regarded as unlinked. However, the avenacin biosynthesis appears to be carried out by an avenacin biosynthetic gene cluster which implies a high degree of coordination regarding avenacin synthesis, transport and sequestration, all of which must be precisely orchestrated in time and space between different cell organelles and compartments |CITS:[21876149] [15148404] [21443624] [20040536]|.
/
/The formation of |FRAME:CPD-12630| (this pathway) as acyl-donor is critical for the biosynthesis of |FRAME:CPD-16599| (see |FRAME:PWY-7474|) and the other |FRAME:BENZOATE| acylated avenacin, i.e. |FRAME:CPD-16598| |CITS: [Crombie86a]|. It has been demonstrated that the C-21 acylation of the avenacin skeleton is pivotal for the biological activity of this antimicrobial agent |CITS:[20835386]|. 
/
/The glucosylation of |FRAME:BENZOATE| is catalyzed by two glucosyltransferases, SAD10 (UGT74H5) and UGT74H6 which are capable to glucosylate both |FRAME:ANTHRANILATE| and |FRAME:BENZOATE|. SAD10 appears to be included in the avenacin biosynthetic gene cluster but UGT74H6, although catalyzing the same reaction, albeit with lower efficiency, may have other or additional biochemical functions in <i>Avena</i> |CITS:[23258535]|.  Co-expression of three SAD gens, i.e. SAD9 (anthranilate N-methyltransferase), SAD10 (N-methylanthranilate glucosyltransferase) and SAD7 (des-acyl avenacin A acyltransferase) demonstrated that those SAD genes are involved in consecutive steps of the acylation of avenacin and that a loss of any of them resulted in enhanced disease susceptibility of the respective mutant |CITS:[23532069]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/This route of |FRAME: CYS| degradation is shared among bacteria and eukaryotes.  Additional mammalian pathways are shown in |FRAME: CYSTEINE-DEG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5329|.
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562|, L-cysteine degradation is carried out by L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity (CD) |CITS: [9572924]|. CD is known to catalyze the degradation of |FRAME: CYS| to |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, |FRAME: AMMONIA|, and |FRAME: HS| |CITS: [14907623][13271322][12883870][16000837]|. In |FRAME:TAX-562|, cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), primarily catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE| to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS|, |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: AMMONIA| |CITS: [7049234]| while tryptophanase (TnaA) mainly degrades |FRAME: TRP| to |FRAME: INDOLE|, |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: AMMONIA| |CITS: [14171448]|. Both of them have been shown to exhibit CD activity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [704923][1428472][12883870]|.  
/
/It was recently found that in addition to tryptophanase (TnaA) and cystathionine-&beta;-lyase (MetC), three additional proteins exhibit the PLP-dependent-L-cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) activity. These are OAS sulfhydrylase A (CysK), OAS sulfhydrylase B (CysM), and the MalY protein. CysK primarily catalyzes the synthesis of |FRAME: CYS| from |FRAME: ACETYLSERINE| and |FRAME: HS| along the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway (|FRAME: CYSTSYN-PWY|). CysM is considered to be an isomer of CysK with unidentified function. MalY protein has activity of the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage (&beta; C-S lyase) of |FRAME: L-CYSTATHIONINE|. The gene disruption for each protein significantly decreases the CD activity and is effective for overproduction of |FRAME: CYS|. The decrease in CD activity for all these genes disruption is reversed in the presence of |FRAME: CYS| except for the <i>tnaA</i> gene disruption. This result suggests that TnaA is a key enzyme in |FRAME: CYS| degradation in |FRAME:TAX-562|. Disruption of all the <i>tnaA</i>, <i>metC</i>, <i>cysK</i>, <i>cysM</i> and <i>malY</i> genes together also show much higher CD activity in the presence of |FRAME: CYS| than in its absence |CITS: [16000837][16820466]|. Unidentified proteins with CD activity are found, which may be induced by L-cysteine.
/
/Amino acids, |FRAME: TRP|, |FRAME: GLT|, and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| inhibit the CD activity in |FRAME:TAX-562|. |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, which is most similar to |FRAME: CYS| in configuration, shows the greatest amount of inhibition. Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (|FRAME: TRIS|), an effective carbonyl agent also caused significant inhibition to the CD activity |CITS: [13271322]|.

COMMENT - About 20% of methionine is used as a building block of proteins, and the rest
/of the methionine pool is converted to S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) which is a
/methyl donor used for many cellular transmethylation reactions. Utilization
/of the methyl group of SAM is coupled by recycling of the homocysteinyl
/moiety and regeneration of methionine. This is achieved via the SAM cycle,
/also known as the activated methyl cycle. Within the SAM cycle, upon donating
/the methyl group, SAM is converted to S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). SAH is
/then hydrolyzed to homocysteine by SAH hydrolase. The SAH hydrolase reaction
/is reversible and the equilibrium favors the synthesis of SAH not the
/hydrolysis of SAH. Thus removal of the hydrolysis products, homocysteine and
/adenosine, is critical to continual the SAM cycle, which is achieved by
/metabolizing homocysteine to methione via methione synthase. SAM is then
/regenerated from methionine to finish the cycle. The pathway is believed to
/occur universally in many organisms and is located in the cytosol|CITS: [15024005]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|. Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A. These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls. Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene. Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin. The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|. Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|). Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|. In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first committed step of carotenoid biosynthesis is that of the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12321| from
/|FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP|. This conversion is in fact a two-step reaction catalyzed by the enzyme
/|FRAME: MONOMER-14934|.
/Phytoene is then isomerized to |FRAME: PHYTOENE| and undergoes a series of desaturation reactions. The number of these reactions depends on the species and the enzyme. Some enzyme stop after two steps, some catalyze three steps, and some continue with a fourth step, resulting in the formation of |FRAME:CPD1F-114| (see |FRAME:PWY-5942|).
/
/This pathway represents organisms that convert |FRAME: PHYTOENE| to |FRAME: NEUROSPORENE|, such as the purple non-sulfur bacteria |FRAME: TAX-1061| and |FRAME: TAX-1063| that produce |FRAME: CPD-11468| (see |FRAME: PWY-6286|). This conversion proceeds <i>via</i> the intermediates |FRAME:CPD-7408| and |FRAME:CPD1F-98|.
/The desaturation steps use all-<i>trans</i> compounds.

/ |FRAME: CPD-7043 Amylopectin|, on the other hand is a much more branched
/molecule with many &alpha;(1->6) linkages and contains up to several million glucosyl residues. At least twelve different types of starch with different branching patterns and chain lengths have been reported |CITS: [ROBYT13]|. To further complicate the situation, |FRAME: Starch starch| can appears in different crystalline and soluble forms which are difficult to define and depict using standard chemical structures.
/
/It has been reported that cyanobacteria synthesize glycogen while red algae produce
/floridean-starch with structure that is intermediate between starch and glycogen, and that green algae
/accumulate amylopectin-like polysaccharides. However, some cyanobacteria have distinct
/&alpha;-polyglucans (which were designated as semi-amylopectin), making them a transition point
/between glycogen and starch biosynthesis |CITS: [15695453]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: Starch Starch| is synthesized in plastids, including chloroplasts in photosynthetic tissues and amyloplasts in
/non-photosynthetic tissues such as seeds, roots, and tubers. Starch synthesized in
/chloroplasts of photosynthetic tissues is degraded to maltose and glucose during the dark period (see |FRAME: PWY-6724|).
/These sugars are exported to the cytosol and used in |FRAME: PWY-7238 sucrose synthesis|.
/Sucrose can be readily transported to non-photosynthetic tissues to support plant growth or for starch synthesis in amyloplasts.
/
/The |FRAME: Starch|  biosynthesis pathway depicted here includes both chloroplast and amyloplast pathways.
/The starting point for the chloroplast pathway is fructose-6-phosphate, a product of photosynthetic carbon
/fixation. The starting point for amyloplast pathway is glucose-1-phosphate, a product of sucrose
/degradation. Studies from potato, pea, and maize indicate that glucose-6-phosphate, in addition to
/glucose-1-phosphate, can be imported into the amyloplast and can serve as the starting point for
/starch biosynthesis |CITS: [10929100]|.
/
/The role of plastidial &alpha;-phosphorylase enzymes (|FRAME: RXN-1826 2.4.1.1)| in starch biosynthesis remain controversial and may differ between species |CITS: [23393426][BALL09]|. For example, mutations in the |FRAME: AT3G29320| gene of Arabidopsis have no effect on starch biosynthesis |CITS: 15173560|.
/
/Following the initial production of |FRAME: ADP-D-GLUCOSE|, |FRAME:Starch| biosynthesis appears to involve reactions catalyzed by at least three classes of enzymes, i.e. starch synthases, starch branching enzymes and
/starch debranching enzymes |CITS: [BALL09]|. However, the exact steps involved and the order in which they are required for the formation of different types of starch may differ between species and even between different types of cells within the same species |CITS: [15743447]|. 
/
/There is also evidence that |FRAME: TAX-3055| might involve an additional enzyme in |FRAME:PWY-622|, namely, a disproportionating enzyme, |FRAME: GIO2-442|. However the corresponding enzyme, |FRAME: AT5G64860-MONOMER DPE1| in Arabidopsis has been shown to play a part in |FRAME: PWY-6427 starch degradation| instead |CITS: [BALL09][23393426]|.
/
/Developing a better understanding of starch biosynthesis and its regulation is an active area of research.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Sorbitol (D-glucitol) is a polyol found in many fruits (see |FRAME: PWY-5054|).  It is used commercially as a sweetener, 
/humectant, texturizer, softener, and is a precursor of other products of commercial interest including vitamin C 
/(see |FRAME: PWY-5521|).  It is produced by mainly chemical methods.  The Gram-negative, fermentative, 
/&alpha;-proteobacterium |FRAME: TAX-542| has been shown to biosynthesize sorbitol and gluconolactone 
/from glucose and fructose in a one-step enzymatic reaction catalyzed by a unique enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX-7444|.  This 
/reaction has potential for the biotechnological production of sorbitol.  Reviewed in |CITS: [SPRENGER96]| and |CITS: [15304760]|.
/
/This reaction takes place in the periplasm.  Periplasmic glucose and fructose are derived from sucrose in the 
/environment via extracellular levan sucrase (LevU) and sucrase (invertase, InvB) secreted by this organism.  
/Glucose and fructose enter the cell by a facilitated diffusion system.  These extracellular enzymes 
/allow <i>Z. mobilis</i> to utilize sucorse from sugar-rich plant saps, or honey as an energy source |CITS: [10333527]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [SPRENGER96]| and |CITS: [15304760]|.
/
/Glucono-&delta;-lactone in the periplasm is converted to gluconate by a lactonase.  Sorbitol and gluconate are 
/transported into the cytosol via sorbitol and gluconate carriers.  Sorbitol is not metabolized further.  It accumulates 
/in the cytosol and may serve as an osmoprotectant when the organism grows in 
/environments of high external osmolarity created by high concentrations of sugars, such as in saps from dessicated 
/plants (in |CITS: [8002594]| and reviewed in |CITS: [SPRENGER96]|).  Gluconate is converted to 
/6-phosphogluconate, which enters the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as shown by the pathway link.  Pyruvate 
/produced by this pathway, or by subsequent glycolytic reactions (see the pathway link 
/in |FRAME: ENTNER-DOUDOROFF-PWY|) is fermented anaerobically to mainly ethanol and carbon dioxide 
/(see |FRAME: PWY-5486|).  Reviewed in |CITS: [SPRENGER96]| and |CITS: [15304760]|. 
/
/Glucose and fructose can also directly enter the cytosol via facilitators and are fermented anaerobically to mainly 
/ethanol and carbon dioxide.  Aerobically, acetaldehyde and acetate are also produced.  |FRAME:TAX-542| 
/is a source of biotechnologically produced ethanol (in |CITS: [9805385]|).  Reviewed in |CITS: [SPRENGER96]| and |CITS: [15304760]|.

CITATIONS - 16448336
CITATIONS - 16448336:EV-EXP-TAS:3347911569:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Chlorophyll degradation, corresponding to the loss of green color, is an integral part of leaf senescence and fruit ripening |CITS:[16113212],[15012204],[10767575],[ 12675736]|.  Chlorophyll degradation occurs in plastids and is divided into early steps which are common to all plants and lead to the production of a colourless, blue-fluorescing intermediate (primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite or pFCC) <i>via</i> the formation of a red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC).  The final steps of chlorophyll catabolism are species-specific and involve a diversity of modifications of pFCC before the catabolites are finally stored in the vacuole in the form of NCCs |CITS:[15012204],[16448336]|.  NCCs share a common tetrapyrrolic skeleton with an oxygenolytically opened porphyrin macrocycle |CITS:[KRAEUTER03]|, with peripheral, species-specific modification at several side chains within different NCCs.  The final conversion of modified FCCs to NCCs is a non-enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the acidic vacuolar pH.
/
/<b>Enzymatic steps:</b>  One of the first step of chlorophyll degradation is dephytylation, or removal of the phytol moiety of the compound.  A substantial portion of this phytol remains esterified with fatty acids |CITS:[PATTERSON93]| and with acetic acid |CITS:[BORTLIK90]|, whilst the rest is photooxidatively converted into various isoprenoid compounds |CITS:[RONTANI96]|.  This step is catalyzed by chlorophyllases which have been described in several plants species (for review see |CITS:[16448336]|) and acts primarily on chlorophyll <i>a</i>.
/
/The second enzyme of the pathway, Mg dechelatase, remains elusive.  This enzyme catalyzes the release of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from chlorophyllide <i>a</i> in exchange from two protons to form pheophorbide <i>a</i>.  Since the purification of the protein has been unsuccessful and has led to the detection of a low-molecular-weight compound rather than a protein, the removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from chlorophyllide <i>a</i> has been postulated to be performed by a 'Mg-dechelating substance', or MCS.  It is uncertain whether MCS represents an active cofactor of Mg-dechelatase.  The structure of either Mg-dechelatase or MCS remains to be determined |CITS:[16448336]|.
/
/The next two steps are decisive in the loss of green colour.  The ring-opening of, and production of the first identifiable colourless product pFCC from pheophorbide <i>a</i> requires two proteins from gerontoplasts membranes and stroma.  Opening of the ring through oxygenolysis of pheophorbide <i>a</i> is catalyzed by the membrane-localized,  nonheme iron-containing monooxygenase, pheophorbide <i>a</i> oxygenase (PaO) which yields red bilin RCC.  This compound is channeled to RCCR which further reduces it to form pFCC.  Both enzymes use reduced ferredoxin as immediate electron donor|CITS: [15012204]|.

COMMON-NAME - methylerythritol phosphate pathway II
CITATIONS - 23451776:EV-EXP:3655229119:zhang
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) can occur via two distinct routes: the |FRAME: PWY-922| (MVA pathway) and the |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY| (MEP pathway, this pathway) |CITS: [11078528]|. In the former, IPP is synthesized from the condensation of  three acetyl-CoA molecules; in the MEP pathway IPP is synthesized via the condensation of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: GAP|.
/
/For many years, the MVA pathway was considered to be the sole source of IPP in all living organisms. However, several inconsistencies led to the discovery of the MEP pathway in bacteria and plants.
/In plants the MVA pathway is located in the cytosol whilst the MEP pathway is found in plastids |CITS:[LICHTENTHALER97]|. The MEP pathway is present in most eubacteria, unicellular green algae, the chloroplasts of phototrophic organisms and some unicellular eukaryotes related to photosynthetic phyla, such as the Plasmodium parasites |CITS: [15473867]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP "Isopentenyl diphosphate"| (IPP) and its isomer |FRAME: CPD-4211| (DMAPP) are the fundamental units in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Both are produced from |FRAME: GAP| and |FRAME: PYRUVATE| via this pathway.
/
/D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield |FRAME: DEOXYXYLULOSE-5P| (DOXP). DOXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, |FRAME: 2-C-METHYL-D-ERYTHRITOL-4-PHOSPHATE| (MEP). 
/Interestingly, two rather different enzymes, that share no sequence homology, are able to catalyze this reaction - the |FRAME: DXPREDISOM-CPLX "DXR"| enzymes, and the |FRAME:MONOMER-15827 "DRL"| (DXR-like) enzymes |CITS: [20660776]|.
/
/In the third reaction MEP is converted into |FRAME: 4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C|, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding
/|FRAME: 2-PHOSPHO-4-CYTIDINE-5-DIPHOSPHO-2-C-MET|. This product is then converted into
/|FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. Subsequently, it is reduced to generate |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| |CITS: [12198182]|.
/
/This diphosphate compound is converted by a single enzyme into a 5-6:1 ratio of IPP and DMAPP in the final step. In |FRAME: TAX-562| this ratio is subsequently adjusted to 3:7 by |FRAME: IPPISOM-MONOMER|. IPP and DMAPP serve as the basic building blocks of polyisoprenoid biosynthesis.  
/
/The difference between this pathway variant and the bacterial variant described in |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY| is the conversion of |FRAME: HYDROXY-METHYL-BUTENYL-DIP| to |FRAME: 2C-METH-D-ERYTHRITOL-CYCLODIPHOSPHATE|. In this variant, that enzyme utilizes ferredoxin as the electron donor (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.1|), while in the other variant the enzyme utilizes flavodoxin (|FRAME: EC-1.17.7.b|).
/
/This pathway, which is not present in humans, is involved in production of phosphate-containing antigens recognized by &gamma;-&delta; T lymphocytes |CITS: [11675382]|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are beta-thio-glucosides. They are found prominently in the order Capparales, which includes cabbage, 
/mustard, oilseed rape, broccoli, and the model plant Arabidopsis. In addition to be responsible for the typical sharp taste 
/and odor of many glucosinolate-producing plants, glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. In plant herbivore 
/defense, upon insect chewing on the plant tissues, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed and broken down to toxic compounds by 
/the myrosinase (beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) system. In this process, bioactive isothiocyanate, simple nitrile and 
/epithionitrile are produced from aliphatic glucosinolates, whereas, only isothiocyante and simple nitrile are produced from 
/indole glucosinolates |CITS: [18346197]|. Additionally, indole glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed in vivo in living plant cells by the 
/specific myrosinase PEN2-dependent pathway |FRAME: PWYQT-4477 indole glucosinolate breakdown (active in intact plant cell)|. The hydrolysis products in the PEN2- pathway are different from the insect 
/chewing induced indole glucosinolate degradation, and are found bioactive in broad-spectrum antifungal defense |CITS: [19095900]|.
/
/The insect chewing-induced pathway, as depicted here, is independent of the previously characterized myrosinases TGG1 and 
/TGG2, as tgg1 tgg2 double mutants excreted a similar metabolite profile as the wild type plants |CITS: [18346197]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The three aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine are all derived from a common 
/precursor chorismate. In tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis, chorismate is first converted to an 
/intermediate prephenate.  There are two possible routes to synthesize phenylalanine or tyrosine from 
/the intermediate prephenate: 1) via arogenate by the activity of prephenate aminotransferase, illustrated 
/here, or 2) via phenylpyruvate by the activity of prephenate dehydratase for phenylalanine synthesis, or 
/via hydroxyphenylpyruvate by the activity of prephenate dehydrogenase for tyrosine synthesis.
/The latter route has been confirmed in many microorganisms 
/including E.coli and yeast. In fact, the two alternative routes have been reported co-exist in 
/microorganisms. However, compiling evidence suggests that many plants may only employ the 
/arogenate route for phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis. There is so far no sound evidence support the 
/other route in plants.

COMMENT - <b>Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE "GABA"| and |FRAME: GLT| are the most abundant neurotransmitters in mammalian brain. While |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE "GABA"| is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, |FRAME: GLT| is an excitatory neurotransmitter. Both are key mediators of synaptic plasticity and neuroendocrine function |CITS: [15571623]|. 
/
/Disturbances in the homeostasis of GABA in the brain are implicated in the development of epilepsy, depression, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, and Stiff-Man syndrome |CITS: [15571623]|. 
/
/The |FRAME: GLUDEG-I-PWY| serves two functions, it can mediate both the catabolism of |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE "GABA"| and channels |FRAME: GLT| to the |FRAME: PWY66-398|, bypassing two steps of that cycle |CITS: [OLSEN]|.
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway forms a closed loop whose function is the production and conservation of the supply of GABA in the central nervous system across a variety of neural cells. The first step is the transamination of |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| formed in the |FRAME: PWY66-398|, to |FRAME: GLT| by the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenases |CITS: [8207021]|. In the next step, the cytosolic glutamate decarboxylases |FRAME: CPLX-6887 "GAD67"| and |FRAME: CPLX-6889 "GAD65"| catalyze the decarboxylation of |FRAME: GLT| to |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE "GABA"| |CITS: [9816471]|. 
/
/GABA then enters the mitochondrion, where the two mitochondrial enzymes are located |CITS: [15003233]|. |FRAME: CPLX-6886| catalyzes the conversion of GABA to |FRAME: SUCC-S-ALD| |CITS: [15528998]|. To conserve the available supply of GABA, this transamination only occurs when |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| is present to accept the amino group removed from GABA, reforming |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [13044808]|. 
/
/The last enzyme of the pathway, |FRAME: CPLX-6888| catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of |FRAME: SUCC-S-ALD| to |FRAME: SUC| |CITS: [12208142]|. The latter compound reenters the |FRAME: PWY66-398| and GABA can be resynthesized from |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|. 
/
/Epileptic convulsions can be controlled by administering drug inhibitors of |FRAME: CPLX-6886|. One such drug which is used in the treatment of some types of epilepsy is |FRAME:VIGABATRIN| |CITS:[8156960]|.

CITATIONS - 12881408
CITATIONS - 12881408:EV-EXP:3338662670:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/L-Fucose is an important monosaccharide found in a diverse array of organisms.  It is a carbohydrate component of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, mammalian and plant glycoproteins (such as the human antigenic glycoproteins or glycolipids of erythrocyte membranes) and various plant cell wall polysaccharides.  It is found in xyloglucans and rhamnogalacturonans I and II.  Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form GDP-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as the donor substrate.
/
/The formation of UDP-Fuc occurs via two routes: a) a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route from GDP-D-mannose (this pathway), and b) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-Fuc from free L-fucose (|FRAME:PWY-6|).  
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of GDP-Fuc from GDP-D-mannose (GDP-Man) comprises three catalytic steps, a 4,6-dehydration, a 3,5-epimerization, and a 4-reduction.  The first reaction step is catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose-4,6-dehydratase which involved the formation of the intermediate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose.  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the <i>MUR1</i> encodes a protein which was shown to possess this catalytic activity.  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <i>E.coli</i> and humans, the second and third reactions steps have been shown to be catalyzed by a single bifunctional polypeptide: GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase |CITS:[12881408],[9525924],[8910301]|.  The coexpression of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MUR1</i> and <i>GER1</i> (encoding for GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase) genes in yeast cells led to the production of GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man |CITS:[12881408]|.

COMMENT - All three branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, are essential amino acids, which human and animals must obtain from their diet. The biosynthesis pathways in plants are largely inferred from microbial pathways. Valine and leucine are both derived from pyruvate. Their biosynthesis shares the same initial steps. On the other hand, isoleucine is derived from threonine. However, the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway is almost parallel to valine biosynthesis, except for its first step which involves a threonine deaminase. These two pathways share four common enzymes, each enzyme has dual substrate specificity.
/
/Many steps in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathways are commercially significant targets for herbicides. They include threonine deaminase, acetolactate synthase, and ketol-acid reductoisomerase. 
/
/This pathway occurs in plastids.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The tripeptide thiol glutathione (GSH; L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine) 
/is ubiquitous in the vast majority of organisms. It is considered the most abundant low-molecular weight 
/plant thiol reaching concentrations up to 2-3 mM in the cytoplasm |CITS: [11489184]|. In plants glutathione 
/is linked to many processes, particularly to such involved in protection against a variety of environmental 
/stresses |CITS: [15308753]|. 
/
/While the |FRAME:GLUTATHIONESYN-PWY| is well investigated |CITS: [Noctor98]| the degradation of 
/glutathione and its physiological role in plants remains less well understood. However, the homeostasis of 
/glutathione appears to be crucial for many pathways including those involved in cellular defense and sulfur 
/metabolism |CITS: [11997376]|. In contrary to the biosynthesis of glutathione that takes place in the cytoplasma 
/|CITS: [15610346]| the degradation of glutathione has been shown to occur in the apoplastic space |CITS: [17316175]| 
/and/or the vacuole |CITS: [17316176]| indicating a rescue mechanism of valuable compounds. Therefore 
/the degradation of glutathione has been proposed as a mean to provide for the &gamma;-glutamyl cycle, 
/hence forming &gamma;-glutamyl amino acids that can be recycled and transferred back into the cell |CITS: [MEISTER95]|. 
/
/The ability of &gamma;-glutamyltransferases (GGT's) to transfer the &gamma;-glutamyl group of glutathione 
/to a diversity of acceptors |CITS: [2868390]| provides the metabolic tool to both degrade glutathione and form 
/a variety of &gamma;-glutamyl amino acid and cysteinylglycine. It has been proposed that GGT's may contribute 
/to xenobiotics metabolism by processing the sequestration and further metabolism of glutathione conjugates 
/|CITS: [17316176]| similar to the detoxifying role of GHS S-transferases forming less reactive or storage conjugates 
/|CITS: [16665956]| |CITS: [15012285]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The degradation of glutathione in this pathway is carried out by two enzymes, the 
/&gamma;-glutamyltransferase (syn. &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase) and an extracellular dipeptidase 
/that has not yet been characterized in Arabidopsis. As a result the amino acids L-glutamate, L-cystein and 
/glycine are released from glutathione. 
/
/The first and key-enzymatic step is the cleavage of the &gamma;-peptide bond between glutamate and cysteine 
/within the glutathione molecule. The only enzyme known to catalyze this step, i.e. &gamma;-glutamyltransferase 
/has been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> as a small gene family of four members (GGT1 - 4). While 
/GGT1 - 3 have been shown to exhibit &gamma;-glutamyltransferase activity the fourth member (GGT4, At1g69820) 
/is considered a pseudogene |CITS: [17316175]|. 
/
/The three GGT's identified in Arabidopsis are specifically expressed in different tissues indicating a 
/non-redundant role of glutathione degradation within the plants. The apoplastic GGT1 is mostly active in vascular

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The overall superpathway of threonine biosynthesis as shown here covers the entire process of converting
/the central energy metabolism molecule oxaloacetate into threonine.
/
/This pathway is regulated at multiple points by its end product, both via enzyme inhibition and attenuation.
/Attenuation in response to isoleucine and threonine represses the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth steps in
/this pathway. In addition, the enzymatic activity of ThrA is inhibited by threonine, regulating flux
/through the second and fourth steps in the pathway.
/
/The presence of three enzymes carrying out the second step and two enzymes carrying out the fourth
/step in the threonine biosynthesis pathway reflects the many downstream products that depend on those
/reaction steps. Look at the |FRAME: P4-PWY| for a full explanation of the overarching regulatory relationships
/affecting these pathway steps.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Blood glucose levels in mammals are maintained during fasting by utilization of liver glycogen stores. When this reserve is depleted, glucose must be generated from non-sugar carbon substrates in the process known as gluconeogenesis |CITS: [Salway]|. Most of the reactions in the process are the exact reversal of |FRAME: PWY66-400 "glycolysis"| reactions. However, the three reactions of glycolysis catalyzed by |FRAME: HS02935-MONOMER|/|FRAME: HS08136-MONOMER "hexokinase"|, |FRAME: HS00894-MONOMER "phosphofructokinase"| and |FRAME: HS00906-MONOMER "pyruvate kinase"| that occur with a free energy change are circumvented during gluconeogenesis by using different enzymes.
/
/Gluconeogenesis in mammals is perfomed primarily in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney cortex and intestine. The pathway is considered to start with pyruvate. The liver utilizes mainly lactate (|FRAME: EC-1.1.1.27|) and alanine (|FRAME: EC-2.6.1.2|) as the pyruvate source |CITS: [458501]|. Glycerol can also function as a gluconeogenic precursor, entering the pathway at the level of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (|FRAME: EC-2.7.1.30| and |FRAME: EC-1.1.1.8|).
/
/Lactate is formed in skeletal muscle cells during anaerobic glycolysis |CITS: [14960150]|. It is converted to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. The conversion of glucose to lactate and back to glucose is referred to as the Cori cycle |CITS: [5355347][10484349]|.
/
/In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs during periods of fasting or rigorous exercise. As carbohydrates are limited under these circumstances, it is often associated with ketosis. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is tightly regulated by the opposing actions of insulin and glucagon |CITS: [19450513]|. 
/
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b> 
/
/In mammals gluconeogenesis is initiated in the mitochondria with the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. This reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: HS10697-MONOMER "pyruvate carboxylase"| and requires 1 molecule of ATP |CITS: [13840551]|. The enzyme is stimulated by high levels of acetyl coA produced by &beta; oxidation of fatty acids and inhibited by high levels of ADP |CITS: [9597748]|.
/
/Most of the remaining steps of gluconeogenesis occur in the cytosol. Since oxaloacetate cannot leave the mitochondria, two enzymes, |FRAME: HS07366-MONOMER| and |FRAME: CPLX-7322|, form part of a shuttle to transport oxaloacetate from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is first reduced to malate in an NADH-dependent reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: HS07366-MONOMER|. Malate is transported into the cytosol and oxidized back to oxaloacetate by |FRAME: CPLX-7322| |CITS: [6849808]|.
/
/The cytosolic |FRAME: HS04751-MONOMER "phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase"| decarboxylates and phosphorylates oxaloacetate to form phosphoenolpyruvate at the expense of 1 mole of GTP |CITS: [6304730]|. The next steps are akin to reverse glycolysis, with the exception of the rate limiting step of gluconeogenesis, the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, which is catalyzed by the gluconeogenic enzyme |FRAME: HS09189-MONOMER "fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase" | |CITS: [8387495]|.
/
/The final step of gluconeogenesis occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed to glucose by |FRAME: HS05538-MONOMER| |CITS: [12093795]|. Glucose transporters in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane then shuttle glucose into the cytoplasm |CITS: [8211187]|. Since many tissues (for example, skeletal muscle) lack glucose-6-phosphatase, in these tissues gluconeogenesis is utilized for the synthesis of glycogen rather than free glucose.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (UTP and CTP) can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> (see
/|FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing pyrimidines (uracil and cytosine) or their nucleosides (uridine and
/cytidine) that might be present in the environment.  Any of these four compounds can serve as a total
/source of pyrimidine for both ribonucleoside triphosphates and subsequently for both deoxyribonucleoside
/triphosphates as well (see |FRAME: PWY0-166|).  Exogenously supplied cytosine is rapidly converted to
/uracil and subsequently converted to UMP which flows through a portion of the <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine
/biosynthesis pathway to UTP and CTP. 
/
/Although enzymes are present in <i>E. coli</i> that are capable of converting cytidine directly to CTP, in
/fact exogenously supplied cytidine does not flow through this pathway.  Instead, a very active cytidine
/deaminase converts it rapidly to uridine, which then flows to UTP and then to CTP.  The existence of the
/direct pathway from cytidine to CTP is an accident of the lack of specificity of uridine kinase. 
/Exogenously supplied cytidine will flow directly to CTP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation.  A
/CMP-specific kinase is present in <i>E. coli</i>.  Its purpose is not to utilize externally supplied cytosine. 
/Instead, it is to recover CMP generated intracellularly by the hydrolytic turnover of RNA.

/
/Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: GAPOXNPHOSPHN-RXN "glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase"| slowly catalyzes the formation of a hydrated form of NADH, called |FRAME: NADHX|, from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible. In addition, NADHX can be formed spontaneously from NADH under slightly acidic conditions.
/
/NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. This is achieved by the enzyme |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER| which has been originally described from yeast |CITS: [Meinhart56]|. Upon identification of the yeast enzyme it was found that homologs are found in the overwhelming majority of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The human and yeast enzymes also accept (S)-NADPHX, with higher maximal activity |CITS: [21994945]|.
/
/Since both |FRAME: CPD0-2472| and |FRAME: CPD-653| are formed, but |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER| can only accept the <i>S</i>-form, the <i>R</i> form needs to be epimerized to the <i>S</i>-form before it can converted back to NADH. This is achieved by the enzyme |FRAME: ENSG00000163382-MONOMER| |CITS: [21994945]|. 
/
/While the two enzymes are encoded by two different genes in yeast and humans, in |FRAME:TAX-562| a single bifunctional protein (encoded by the |FRAME: EG11758 YjeF| gene) is responsible for catalyzing both reactions. However, that protein differs from the eukaryotic proteins by using ADP rather than ATP to drive the dehydration reaction |CITS: [21994945]|.

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In this eukaryotic route of aspartate degradation, aspartate is converted to malate as part of the reversible 
/malate-aspartate shuttle.  This pathway spans the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic spaces, transferring reducing 
/equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane.  It is one of several shuttle mechanisms used to transfer electrons 
/from cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis into the mitochondrion, because NADH itself cannot cross the inner 
/mitochondrial membrane.  Inside the mitochondrion, NADH can be oxidized by the electron transport chain to 
/produce ATP.  
/
/In the cytosolic reactions of this shuttle shown here, oxaloacetate produced by transamination of aspartate is 
/reduced to malate by electrons from NADH.  Malate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix via the 
/malate-&alpha;-ketoglutarate carrier.  There, malate is oxidized by NAD<sup>+</sup> back to oxaloacetate, 
/forming NADH.  Mitochondrial oxaloacetate (which also does not readily cross the inner mitochondrial membrane) 
/is transaminated to aspartate, which can be transported back to the cytosol via the glutamate-aspartate carrier.  
/In the cytosol, oxaloacetate is regenerated by transamination of aspartate.  Because this shuttle is reversible, 
/electrons from NADH are brought into the mitochondrion when the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio is higher in 
/the cytosol than in the mitochondrial matrix.  The malate-aspartate shuttle yields approximately 3 molecules of 
/ATP per molecule of cytosolic NADH |CITS: [VOET04]|.    
/
/In mammals, this shuttle is found in liver, heart and kidney.  The malate-aspartate shuttle may be present in 
/fungi |CITS: [14622413]|.  In plants, however, a malate/oxaloacetate shuttle has been described |CITS: [14671011]|.  
/
/In another route of aspartate degradation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, aspartate is converted to the 
/corresponding keto acid, oxaloacetate (a |FRAME: TCA| intermediate), by the transamination reaction shown here 
/(see pathway |FRAME: ASPARTATE-DEG1-PWY|).  This reversible reaction also biosynthesizes 
/aspartate (see pathway |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  In addition, aspartate is a precursor for many other 
/compounds including lysine, threonine, methionine and NAD<sup>+</sup> (see |FRAME: PWY0-781| and 
/pathway |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  In mammals and most land vertebrates, aspartate can also be 
/degraded by entering the urea cycle at the point of citrulline, and is ultimately converted to fumarate (see 
/pathway |FRAME: PWY-4984|).  In prokaryotes, aspartate can be degraded to fumarate by 
/|FRAME: ASPARTASE-CPLX| (see pathway |FRAME: GLUTDEG-PWY|).

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Cholesterol is an important structural component of eukaryotic cell membranes.  It is also a precursor of steroid
/hormones and bile acids.  The impact of cholesterol and its regulation on human health is well known.  Its role in
/arteriosclerosis, and drug therapy for this process, has been extensively studied (reviewed in |CITS: [10441607]|).
/Nobel prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Konrad Bloch in 1963 and to M. S. Brown and J. L. Goldstein
/in 1985 for their work on the metabolism and regulation of cholesterol.  Several interesting historical reviews detail
/the discovery of cholesterol and work leading to the elucidation of its structure and function |CITS: [5319508],
/[1519268], [11111073]|.
/
/The first nine reactions of cholesterol biosynthesis are shown in the linked mevalonate pathway in HumanCyc.
/Mevalonate is the precursor of isoprenoids, which are involved in the biosynthesis of many classes of compounds
/in addition to cholesterol.  As shown in the mevalonate pathway, the cholesterol molecule is formed from acetate
/units (reviewed in |CITS: [RILLING85], [5319508]|).  The acetate units are joined in a series of reactions
/to form farnesyl pyrophosphate, a branch point for the biosynthesis of other isoprenoid compounds such as
/ubiquinone, dolichol, and farnesylated proteins.  The mevalonate pathway is highly regulated, as reviewed in
/|CITS: [1967820]|.  HMG-CoA reductase from the mevalonate pathway is the rate-determining enzyme for the entire
/pathway from acetate to cholesterol.  This enzyme is the target for the well-known cholesterol-lowering statin drugs
/(reviewed in |CITS: [10441607]|).
/
/Farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (squalene synthase) is the first specific enzyme in cholesterol
/biosynthesis.  It catalyzes a 2-step reaction involving a "head-to-head" condensation of two molecules of farnesyl
/pyrophosphate to form presqualene pyrophosphate |CITS: [HCRILLING], [ALTMANLJ], [COREYEJ]|.
/Presqualene pyrophosphate is then reduced to squalene.  Details of the enzymatic reaction mechanism, which
/involves carbocation intermediates, have been described |CITS: [12137537]|.  The importance of squalene synthase
/has been demonstrated in squalene synthase knockout mice, which results in embryonic lethality and retardation of
/development |CITS: [10521476]|.  Squalene epoxidase (monooxygenase) catalyzes oxygen-dependent epoxidation
/of squalene |CITS: [5438357]|.  Oxidosqualene cyclase (lanosterol synthase) catalyzes its remarkable cyclization,
/in a single reaction, to form lanosterol |CITS: [6027261]|.  This cyclization mechanism was proposed by several
/researchers, but the correct structure was determined by R. B. Woodward and K. Bloch |CITS: [WOODWARD53]|,
/and reviewed in |CITS: [5319508]|.
/
/The enzymology of the multistep conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol was largely determined in rat liver by
/J. L. Gaylor and coworkers (reviewed in |CITS: [11969204]|).  The human pathway is therefore inferred from this
/work.  The order of some of the reactions in this pathway may vary.  The pathway shown here represents the
/reactions in a frequently published order, updated as follows.  The last three reactions, as illustrated in two reviews
/(|CITS: [11969204] [RILLING85]|), have more recently been reordered as shown here (|CITS: [9291139]|,
/in |CITS: [11519011]|, and reviewed in |CITS: [11969204]|).  Previously, the isomerase
/reaction was followed by the &Delta;<sup>5</sup>-desaturase, the &Delta;<sup>7</sup>-reductase (producing
/|FRAME: DESMOSTEROL-CPD|) and the &Delta;<sup>24</sup>-reductase, producing cholesterol
/(as shown by clicking on the pathway link above that leads to pathway |FRAME: PWY66-4|)
/(reviewed in |CITS: [11969204], [RILLING85]|, in |CITS: [Salway04]|).  In the pathway shown here, the isomerase
/reaction is followed by the &Delta;<sup>24</sup>-reductase, the &Delta;<sup>5</sup>-desaturase and the
/&Delta;<sup>7</sup>-reductase, producing cholesterol.  Desmosterol is not shown.  This reordering is based on
/substrate specificity studies of the &Delta;<sup>24</sup> reductase |CITS: [9291139]|.  However, the
/&Delta;<sup>24</sup> double bond reduction can also occur at other times, using other intermediates as
/substrates |CITS: [9291139]|.  This is evidenced by the genetic disorder desmosterolosis.  In this disorder,
/patients have elevated levels of desmosterol in their plasma and tissues due to mutations in the
/&Delta;<sup>24</sup>-reductase gene |CITS: [11519011]|.   Another route involves
/reduction of the &Delta;<sup>24</sup> double bond at the point of lanosterol and leads to the production
/of |FRAME: CPD-8606|.  Metabolism of this compound is shown by clicking on the pathway link above that
/leads to pathway |FRAME: PWY66-3|.
/
/The lanosterol-to-cholesterol conversion involves the oxidative removal of three methyl groups, reduction of double
/bonds, and migration of the lanosterol double bond to a new position in cholesterol (in |CITS: [3997841]| and
/reviewed in |CITS: [11969204]|).  Unlike the mostly cytosolic reactions of the mevalonate pathway, the reactions
/shown here are catalyzed by membrane-bound enzymes (reviewed in |CITS: [11969204],
/[RILLING85]|).  In rat liver, they have been localized in the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [3597431]|.  Solubilization
/and characterization of these enzymes had to be achieved before this segment of the pathway could be determined,
/as reviewed in |CITS: [11969204]|.  Human genes have been identified for all the enzymes in this pathway and
/human disorders of cholesterol metabolism have been associated with genetic defects in most of these enzymes.
/Mouse models also exist for several of these human disorders (|CITS: [12829805]| and reviewed in
/|CITS: [12668600]|).  
/
/In the pathway shown here, the first of the three methyl groups, the 14&alpha; methyl group, is removed from lanosterol
/by a cytochrome P450 isozyme |CITS: [6208195]|.  The reaction proceeds through alcohol and aldehyde
/intermediates |CITS: [3514778]|.  This is followed by decarbonylation with formate release, and
/&Delta;<sup>14</sup> double bond formation.  Details of this reaction mechanism have been published and
/involve formation of a formyl ester intermediate (not shown), suggesting a Bayer-Villiger reaction
/mechanism (|CITS: [2007571]|, and reviewed in |CITS: [11969204]|).  The resulting &Delta;<sup>14</sup> double
/bond of the conjugated diene is then reduced by an NADPH-dependent reductase |CITS: [6444198]|.
/
/Another multienzyme complex, C4 methyl sterol oxidase, removes the second (4&alpha;) and third (4&beta;) methyl
/groups in a sequential oxidative series of reactions that include carboxylic acid intermediates |CITS: [4394229],
/[4398294], [4383278], [4394228]|.  This enzyme is not a cytochrome P450.  It utilizes cytochrome b<sub>5</sub>
/as an electron carrier |CITS: [3949790], [7228857]|.  The first of the two decarboxylation reactions is accompanied
/by epimerization of the 4&beta; methyl group to the 4&alpha; position |CITS: [4401584]|.  Thus, after subsequent
/reduction, the remaining methyl group is in the 4&alpha; orientation for further stereospecific oxidation by this
/enzyme (|CITS: [240818], [SHARPLESSKB]| and in reviews |CITS: [11969204], [RILLING85], [6810750]|).
/
/Following decarboxylation, a 3-ketosteroid intermediate is formed and is reduced by 3-ketosteroid reductase
/|CITS: [4387005], [6946726]|.  The final demethylated intermediate then undergoes isomerization of the
/&Delta;<sup>8(9)</sup> double bond, which moves to the &Delta;<sup>7(8)</sup> position of the sterol B-ring
/|CITS: [4404598], [2422166]|.  The &Delta;<sup>24</sup>-reductase then catalyzes reduction of the side chain
/double bond |CITS: [9291139]|.  The &Delta;<sup>5</sup>-desaturase is a multienzyme system utilizing
/cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> as an electron carrier.  It catalyzes formation of the &Delta;<sup>5</sup> double
/bond to form 7-dehydro-cholesterol (|CITS: [3949790], [3997841]|, and in |CITS: [10651635]|).  The terminal
/enzyme of the pathway reduces the &Delta;<sup>7</sup> double bond to form cholesterol |CITS: [LEEJN]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Thioredoxins are ubiquitous small proteins, i.e. thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases, which contain a reactive disulfide bridge. Therefore reduced thioredoxins have the ability to regulate a vast number of physiological functions by reducing disulfide bridges on target proteins. The so oxidized thiredoxins are then reduced back by thioredoxin reductases; the cyclic process referred to as thioredoxin system |CITS:[15012197]|. Thioredoxins are found in different cellular components such as cytosol (TRXh), mitochondria and chloroplasts (TRXm, f, x and y). Those thioredoxins are reduced by different electron donor systems; the chloroplastic thioredoxins using ferredoxin and the cytosolic/mitochondrial thioredoxins NADPH as electron source |CITS:[15642341]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Two genes (NTRA, NTRB) encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of thioredoxin disulfide reductase have been identified and partially characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[8308900]|. Using knock-out mutants of Arabidopsis the two genes have been shown to both express two splice variants each, encoding for cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms. The results indicate that NTRA codes mainly for the cytosolic isoform and NTRB represents the major mitochondrial form |CITS:[8308900]| |CITS:[15642341]|.
/
/Recently a third isoform NTRC has been identified in rice which counterpart in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> appears to be involved in plant protection against oxidative stress |CITS:[15292215]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:MYRICETIN Myricetin| and its glycosides belong to the subclass of flavonols, which constitute one of the largest groups within the flavonoids and stand out because of the magnitude of modifications on the flavonol core  |CITS:[17587669]| |CITS:[16137727]|. Glucosylation is an important and regular modification reaction in plant metabolism. The attachment of sugar molecules enables several strategies; it is protective, stabilizing and adds properties such as solubility for transport of molecules tolerance |CITS: [10973093]|. Flavonols inclusive |FRAME:MYRICETIN| and its glucosides are wide spread in the plant kingdom (e.g. |CITS:[22279376]|) and have a variety of useful pharmacological properties. |FRAME:MYRICETIN Myricetin|  prevents aggregation of amyloids which cause Alzheimer's disease |CITS:[22961751]| |CITS:[22995388]| and show antiviral, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, hypoglycemic, anticancer and diuretic activity |CITS:[22279376]| |CITS:[22195992]|. Flavonol glucosides, inclusive |FRAME:MYRICETIN| glucosides, are involved in flower coloration |CITS:[22485167]|, hence playing a part  in developmental processes in plants. 
/
/Myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucosyltransferases |CITS:[Fukuchi-Mitzutani11]| |CITS:[19733370]| and myricetin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside 1,6-glucosyltransferases |CITS:[19561332]| |CITS:[17940060]| are the enzymes catalyzing the formation of |FRAME:CPD-14844| via |FRAME:CPD-14843|. Although the glucosyltransferases serve a broader spectrum of flavonoids and phenolics (for example see |FRAME:PWY-7137|, |FRAME:PWY-7143|) the observed strict regiospecificity of the glucosyltransferases towards their potential substrates emphasizes a strong preference of flavonoles over other flavonoids or phenolics. The occurrence and physiological role of the various flavonol gentiobiosides remains to be shown.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Oxidative stress in plants often occurs in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The reactive oxygen species that form under oxidative stress can damage numerous biomolecules, including proteins and lipids. The chloroplast, an organelle often subject to oxidative stress, contains a high proportion of |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID linolenic| and |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID linoleic acids| in its membrane. When these prevalent fatty acids undergo lipid peroxidation, a variety of short-chain carbonyls may be formed. A subset of these, &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated carbonyls, such as |FRAME: ACROLEIN acrolein| are known to cause damage to cells and tissues. In chloroplasts, this damage can threaten to disrupt to vital process of photosynthesis |CITS: [18538576][19578873][12694595]|. Therefore, several mechnisms for detoxifying these reactive carbonyl compounds are present in chloroplasts |CITS: [21169366]|. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-based modification of toxic compounds is one robust system that is supported by high levels of glutathione in the chloroplast. But, there is evidence that compounds such as |FRAME: ACROLEIN acrolein| reduce the rate of photosynthesis when glutathione needed for detoxification in not available to allow the function of several Calvin cycle enzymes  |CITS:[19578873]|. The NADPH-dependent set of reactions depicted in this metabolic cluster provide another means for reducing the toxicity of reactive eletrophilic carbonyl compounds in the chloroplast |CITS: [21169366][19616008]|.
/
/Similar pathways for detoxification are likely to exist in the mitochondria and cytosol, but, they will be carried out by a set of related enzymes present in those compartments |CITS: [21169366]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Two different type of enzymatic activities that can be used to minimize the threat posed by reactive carbonyl compounds are shown in this metabolic cluster.
/
/|FRAME: AT1G23740 AOR| acts to reduce the the unsaturated bond on &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated carbonyls, leading to the production of saturated ketones and aldehydes. Although the action of this enzyme is important, it cannot detoxify the whole assortment of reactive carbonyl compounds on its own. First, it does not show strong activity against &alpha;,&beta;-unsaturated carbonyls that have more than 5 carbons. Second, the saturated aldehydes produced by |FRAME: AT1G23740 AOR| can also be dangerous to the plant. Therefore, additional enzymes with over-lapping substrate specificities, namely, a chloroplastic |FRAME: AT2G37770 aldo-keto reductase| and chloroplastic |FRAME: AT1G54870-MONOMER aldehyde reductase| contribute to the protection of this organelle by reducing the carbonyl groups on toxic compounds to yield the corresponding alcohols |CITS: [21169366][19616008]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CHORISMATE Chorismate| is an important intermediate that leads to the biosyntrhesis of several essential metabolites,
/including the aromatic amino acids |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|, vitamins E and K, ubiquinone and certain siderophores |CITS: [4200844][BSUB225][2279393]|.
/
/In this pathway, which is often referred to as <b>the shikimate pathway</b>, chorismate is synthesized from the central metabolite |FRAME:ERYTHROSE-4P|. 
/The pathway is found in prokaryotes (mostly bacteria) and several eukaryotes, including ascomycete fungi, apicomplexans, plants and algae |CITS: [16963634]|. The presence of the pathway in many parasites and pathogens, but not in metazoa, makes it a prime drug target |CITS: [17348836]|. The broad-spectrum systemic herbicide |FRAME: CPD0-1308|, which is used to kill weeds (known best under the tradename Roundup) is an inhibitor of the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.19-RXN "5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase"| (EC 2.5.1.19), which catalyzes a reaction in the pathway (the condensation of |FRAME: SHIKIMATE-5P| and |FRAME: PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE| to form |FRAME: 3-ENOLPYRUVYL-SHIKIMATE-5P|).
/
/The organization and structure of the shikimate pathway enzymes varies between taxonomic groups |CITS: [2824247]|, with a differential distribution of fused genes. In most prokaryotes the seven shikimate pathway enzymes are encoded as separate polypeptides. The plant enzymes (which are nucleus encoded, but assumed to function within the plastid) are also encoded as separate polypeptides, with the exception of AroD and AroE that have fused to a single bifunctional polypeptide.
/In contrast, all fungi, as well as the apicomplexan |FRAME: TAX-5811|, possess a pentafunctional supergene which includes conserved domains homologous to the genes (in fusion order) AroB, AroA, AroL/K, AroD, and AroE |CITS:[2825635][14711585]|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-562|, the first reaction in the pathway is catalyzed by three separate enzymes, each of which is subject to feedback inhibition by one of the three amino acids that are synthesized from chorismate - |FRAME: PHE|, |FRAME: TYR| and |FRAME: TRP|.
/The enzyme subject to regulation by tryptophan (encoded by |FRAME: EG10080|) cannot be inhibited more than 60 percent, ensuring that sufficient enzymatic activity is present to permit synthesis of the other four metabolites synthesized from chorismate even in the presence of all three amino acids |CITS: [Pittard04]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The pyridine nucleotides coenzymes NAD and NADP are omnipresent in all living organisms 
/being involved in a vast amount of reactions with an enormous variety of corresponding enzymes (>17% of all classified 
/enzymes). The majority of these enzymes exhibit absolute stereospecificity and use the coenzymes as the acceptor of a 
/hydride ion (H-) or an equivalent thereof from the substrate in a reversible manner. In most cases the coenzyme specifically 
/interacts with the enzyme which will change the stereochemistry during the reaction resulting in a somewhat modified pyridine 
/nucleotide coenzyme. That is the reason that this coenzymes are also referred to as cosubstrates |CITS: [3157549]|. 
/
/The dynamics and regulative aspects of both phosphorylation and desphosphorylation of NAD and NADH are not well 
/understood. Whereas the importance of e.g. NAD(H) and NADP(H) is obvious through their close involvement in energy 
/metabolism and reductive biosynthesis their interconversion and the role of some of the participating enzymes requires 
/further research.  
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>:  NAD kinases are found in all organisms indicating a crucial role of this enzyme. The enzymes 
/have been discussed in context to a physiological balance and maintenance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as generated 
/in mitochondria |CITS: [15247403]| which have been found to undergo significant ratio changes (NADP+/NAD+) upon 
/oxidative stress |CITS: [11337409]|. On the other side a novel NADH kinase has been identified in <i>Arabidopsis</i> which 
/is not associated with mitochondria and related metabolic processes. The NADH kinase has been discussed in connection with 
/an increased metabolic flexibility of nicotinamide metabolism by uncoupling NADP+ synthesis from the redox status of the 
/corresponding pool but further research is required to precisely describe its physiological role in the cell |CITS: [15347288]|.
/
/The interconversion of NAD+ to NAD(H) can be performed by two enzymes present in this pathway, the NAD transhydrogenase 
/(E.C. 1.6.1.1) where another pyridine nucleotide redox carrier is the acceptor of the hydride ion |CITS: [10548498]| or the 
/NADH dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.6.5.3) also referred to as complex I responsible for the oxidation of NAD(H) and reduction of 
/ubiquinone (and reverse reaction) |CITS: [12837548]|.
/
/The hydrolysis of NADP and NADPH is carried out by corresponding phosphatases in dependence on plant developmental 
/stages and metabolic requirements. The NADP phosphatase activity correlates with the dormancy state of <i>Avena sativa</i> 
/caryopses being involved in the maintenance of steady ratios of NADP and NADPH during seed imbibition in spite of likewise 
/increased NAD kinase activities |CITS: [10944152]|.  Furthermore, an association between the ability of the nitrate reductase 
/to utilize NADPH/NADH and the amount of NADPH phosphatase has been found in corn leaves |CITS: [WELLS74]|.

COMMON-NAME - superpathway of jasmonoyl-amino acid conjugates biosynthesis
CHIMERIC? - T
CITATIONS - PMNSP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This is a superpathway composed of one or more sub-pathways that may have different levels of evidence. All of its sub-pathways have been accepted for this species. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>Please note:</b> Not all of the reactions shown in this superpathway may be found in each of the organisms listed here. Rather, this superpathway has been generated to show the diversity of jasmonyl-amino acid conjugates that are synthesized by a number of different plant species.
/
/Jasmonates are an important class of compounds, related to |FRAME:CPD-734|, found throughout the plant kingdom
/as well as in fungi |CITS:[17513307]|).
/These compounds may participate in a number of biological processes including resistance to herbivores and some
/pathogens, protection against ozone, senescence, and reproductive development (reviewed in |CITS:[19025383][17513307]|). 
/
/Many different jasmonate precursors and jasmonate derivatives have biological activity, including jasmonyl
/(JA)-amino acid conjugates. Different species may have a different array of JA-amino acid conjugates, and the
/biological activity of each compound may differ between species. For example, jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has
/been shown to have biological activity in a number of different plants, including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
/|CITS:[15258265][18247047]|, |FRAME:TAX-49451||CITS:[17273867][17085687]|, <i>Achyranthes bidentata</i>
/|CITS:[18812165]|, barley |CITS:[9315685]|, tomato |CITS:[18458331]|, rice |CITS:[ 9013895]| and others.
/In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, JA-Ile promotes the interaction between COI1 (an F-box) protein and the
/JAZ1 repressor protein. In this manner, JA-Ile is believed
/to help destabilize the JAZ1 repressor and thereby promote JA-responsive transcription |CITS:[17637677]|.
/COI1 and JAZ homologs have been found in other plants, such as tomato, where they also bind in a JA-Ile-dependent
/manner, |CITS:[18458331]|, indicating that JA-Ile might have a similar function in other plant species. However, this has
/not been studied in |FRAME:TAX-49451| to date.
/
/Interestingly, in  <i>Polygonum longisetum</i>, a weed commonly found in Japan, a treatment of 100 uM JA-Ile fails
/to stimulate the normal JA-responsive emissions of volatile sesquiterpenes |CITS:[TAMOGAMI07]| indicating that even
/JA-Ile may not be similarly effective in all plants. Other differences in biological activity have been observed across species for many other conjugates including
/JA-ACC, JA-leucine, and JA-valine. 
/
/The enzymes capable of synthesizing JA-amino acid conjugates are structurally related to the acyl
/adenylate-forming firefly luciferase superfamily of enzymes |CITS:[12084835][15258265]|.
/To date, JA-amino acid synthetase enzymes have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[15258265]|
/and |FRAME:TAX-49451| |CITS:[17273867][17085687]|, but given the widespread identification of these
/compounds in numerous species, homologous enzymes must exist throughout the plant kingdom. 
/
/Additional studies in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that the specific isomeric forms of the same jasmonate can
/have very different biological effects |CITS: [19349968]|.
/For example, initial studies suggested that (-)-JA-Ile was a biologically active phytohormone |CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
/later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
/]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed
/biologically activity originally associated with the (-)-JA-Ile diastereomer. A pure preparation of (-)-JA-Ile does
/does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|. Interestingly, the biologically
/active form, |FRAME: CPD-11259|,
/more closely resembles the potent bacterial phytotoxin coronatine than |FRAME: CPD-11232| does |CITS: [19349968][19377448]|.
/
/In some species, certain JA-amino acid conjugates have no discernable biological activity, e.g. JA-Val in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[15258265]|. It is unclear whether these are storage forms of JA or catabolic intermediates. Another important
/phytohormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), can be conjugated with several amino acids, as shown in the
/|FRAME:PWY-6219| pathway. Some of these compounds, such as IAA-aspartate are targeted for further
/breakdown (|CITS:[9733548]|, (see |FRAME:PWY-2021|), while others, such as, IAA-alanine may serve
/as storage forms. A family of amido hydrolases can release free, active IAA from some of these
/"storage" IAA conjugates |CITS:[7792259][10072397]|. But, to date, no JA-amido hydrolases (that could release free
/JA from the amino acid conjugates) have been identified in plants. However, this enzymatic activity has been
/detected in the fungus, <i>Botryodiplodia theobromae</i> |CITS:[9141491]|.
/Further work will be required to determine the metabolic and functional fate of the "inactive" JA-amino acid
/conjugates in different species.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The catabolic activities involved in the degradation of cyanate in plants 
/correspond to the outlined pathway in microorganisms |CITS: [12232176]|. The first enzyme, catalyzing 
/the hydratation of cyanate to form the intermediate carbamate and final products ammonia and carbon 
/dioxide (former EC 4.3.99.1 has been changed to the present EC 4.2.1.104) has not yet been identified 
/in Arabidopsis. The second step catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (syn. carbonate dehydratase - EC 4.2.1.1) 
/comprises the reversible hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate, a reaction underlying many diverse physiological 
/processes |CITS: [ 8673298]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Carbonic anhydrases (CA's) in plants are divided into three groups, &alpha;-CA, 
/&beta;-CA and &gamma;-CA. Carbon anhydrases are zinc metalloenzymes representing one of the most 
/abundant soluble proteins in leaves of higher plants |CITS: [REED81]|. Although identified in the three domains 
/of life: archaea, bacteria and plants, underlining their vital metabolic importance, none of the carbonic 
/anhydrases have been characterized in plants on a biochemical basis. However, their various functions 
/exceeding the mere detoxification of cyanate has been the late focus in research elucidating the catalytic 
/function |CITS: [12147257]| and role of CA's in plant metabolism.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In this pathway multiple units of |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP| (IPP) undergo a series of
/polymerizations to form a polyisoprenoid chain.
/
/The sequential addition of isoprenyl units to |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| is performed by polyprenyl
/diphosphate synthase enzymes such as the |FRAME:TAX-562| enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-7426|.
/
/Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by the specific enzyme.
/Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the
/polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules, such as quinones.
/The enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a
/preference towards a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone
/molecule is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.
/
/In most organisms there is one type of a predominant quinone, with a specific polyprenyl chain length.
/However, most organisms also have minor amounts of quinones with a different polyprenyl chain
/length.
/Quinones containing chains of 8 prenyl units are found in all kingdoms of life. They are particularly
/common among the |FRAME: TAX-2157| (in the form of menaquinone-8) and the |FRAME: TAX-543|.
/For a review detailing the distribution of polyprenyl chain length in different bacteria, see |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-83333| the initial addition of two isoprenyl units to form |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP| is
/catalyzed by |FRAME: FPPSYN-MONOMER|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10508|.
/Additional isoprenoid units are added sequentially to a maximal length of 8 units by
/|FRAME: CPLX0-7426|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10017|.

CITATIONS - 17611796:EV-EXP:3579466211:dreher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6956 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Thiamin biosynthesis is composed of the separate formation of the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties, which are subsequently coupled to form |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| (see |FRAME: PWY-6893|).
/
/This pathway describes the last part of the thiamin biosynthesis pathway in |FRAME: TAX-1280| - the coupling of the two moieties of thiamin, the thiazole and the pyrimidine, forming |FRAME: THIAMINE-P|, and its phosphorylation to the biologically active form, |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|.
/
/While most bacteria achieve this phosphorylation in a single step, catalyzed by |FRAME: THI-P-KIN-MONOMER| (|FRAME: G6234|) (see |FRAME: PWY-6893|), eukaryotes lack that enzyme and instead utilize a pathway where |FRAME: THIAMINE-P| is first dephosphorylated to |FRAME: THIAMINE|, which is then diphosphorylated to |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| (see |FRAME: THISYNARA-PWY|) |CITS: [19888457]|.
/
/The first step in this pathway is catalyzed in Arabidopsis by the TH1 gene product, a multifunctional, chloroplast-localized protein capable of catalyzing several sequential steps in thiamin (vitamin B1) biosynthesis |CITS: [17174261] [16666289]|.
/
/The next step, |FRAME: MONOMERQT-4131 "Thiamin phosphate phosphatase"|, has been detected in partially purified Arabidopsis extracts, and was associated with a low molecular weight (~10 kD) protein |CITS: [16666289]|. However, the exact identity of this enzyme is still not known. 
/
/The last step in the pathway is catalyzed in Arabidopsis by two similar cytosolic proteins, |FRAME: AT1G02880| and |FRAME: AT2G44750| |CITS: 17611796|.
/
/The subcellular compartmentalization of thiamine biosynthesis is a subject of on-going investigation. While the Arabidopsis proteins TH1, ThiC, and TH1, which catalyze the early parts of the pathway,  all localize to the chloroplasts |CITS:[18048325][18332905][17174261][11575719]|, the downstream TPK1 and TPK2 enzymes are both cytosolic in Arabidopsis |CITS:[17611796]|, suggesting that intermediates in the vitamin B1 biosynthesis pathway may need to be transported out of organelles for TPP synthesis to be completed.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal hormones that regulate the growth and development of plants. The most abundant and widely occurring BRs are C28 steroids, and among them, brassinolide (BL) is the most biologically active one. The biosynthesis pathway of BL was initially elucidated by extensive metabolic studies which suggested parallel-branched pathways, namely the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways (|FRAME: PWY-699|).  In all plant species examined to date, the 6-deoxo intermediates are predominant indicating that the late C-6 oxidation branch is the main route. Following the identification and biochemical characterization of CYP P450s involved in BR biosynthesis, an early C-22 oxidation branch (|FRAME: PWY-2582|) was proposed which was indicated to be the dominant route leading to BL biosynthesis. More recently, a new shortcut via C-23 hydroxylation following C-22 oxidation was demonstrated (|FRAME: PWY-2582|). Additional modifications (for example, lactonization) of the intermediates have also been reported |CITS: [18685225]|. The BL biosynthesis pathway may be best represented as a grid where substantial interconnections between the different proposed routes exist |CITS: [17138693], [12529536]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Benzoic acid, derived from phenylalanine, is a precuror to several important benzenoid compounds, including floral scent constituents, such as |FRAME:CPD-12217 phenylethylbenzoate|, |FRAME:CPD-6443 benzylbenzoate| |FRAME:CPD-6441 methylbenzoate| |CITS:[15286288][12884048][12226525][12361714]|; the defense signaling compounds salicylic acid (SA) and its derivatives |CITS:[19400653][19820324]|, and a number of pharmacologically active compounds, such as taxol |CITS: [11095755 ]| (rev in |CITS: [16600669]|).  An important step in the creation of benzoic acid is the cleavage of two carbon atoms from the 3-carbon side-chain present on trans-cinnamic acid. At least three different chain-shortening routes have been proposed in plants |CITS: [15286288]| and there is evidence that a subset of the different pathways may operate in individual species, and may differentially contribute to benzoic acid biosynthesis within each species. For example, |FRAME:TAX-4102 <i>Petunia x hybrida</i>| has at least two pathways present (this pathway and benzoate biosynthesis I (CoA-dependent, &beta;-oxidative)(see PlantCyc)), whereas cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>) and <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i> seem to lack this variant |CITS: [11219576]| and <i>Hypericum androsaemum</i> relies on a third pathway (benzoate biosynthesis III (CoA-dependent, non-&beta;-oxidative) (see PlantCyc)) that incorporates elements of the other two variants. 
/
/A greater understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in benzoic acid biosynthesis may contribute to genetic engineering efforts aimed at altering floral scents, modifying SA-based defense responses, and increasing the production of pharmaceutically important compounds |CITS: [17234289][17511599]|.
/
/Although benzoate biosynthesis has been primarily studied in plants, there is evidence that |FRAME: TAX-115828 <i>Streptomyces maritimus</i>| bacteria make |FRAME: BENZOYLCOA benzoyl-CoA| using the early steps in the |FRAME: PWY-6443 benzoate biosynthesis I (CoA-dependent, &beta;-oxidative)| pathway |CITS: [12502351]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In this pathway, the chain shortening is accomplished through the removal of an acetate in the third reaction giving rise to |FRAME: BENZALDEHYDE benzaldehyde|. Although this compound does not function as an intermediate in the |FRAME: PWY-6443 benzoate biosynthesis I (CoA-dependent, &beta;-oxidative)| pathway, the characterization of benzaldehyde dehydrogenases in snapdragon and Arabidopsis indicate that benzoic acid can be generated from this precursor in a subset of plant species |CITS:[19292760][19297586]|.
/
/PAL, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in this reaction is subject to regulation in many plant species and thus controls the flux through many secondary metabolic biosynthetic pathways. More specific regulation may be achieved in this pathway through fine-tuned expression of downstream enzymes. For example, transcript levels of the snapdragon |FRAME: CPLX-8012 benzaldehyde dehydrogenase| are highest in the parts of the flower that produce scent (the upper and lower petal lobes) and they also show developmental and diurnal changes that are correlated with the production of methylbenzoate and benzoic acid respectively |CITS: [19292760]|. On the other hand |FRAME: AT5G04580-MONOMER benzaldehyde dehydrogenase / benzaldehyde oxidase| transcripts seem to be expressed predominantly in developing seeds in Arabdopsis |CITS: [19297586]|.
/
/Despite years of study, little is known about the subcellular localization of various components of the benzoic acid biosynthesis pathways. The finding that the snapdragon benzaldehyde dehydrogenase localizes to the mitochondria |CITS: [19292760]| while the Arabidopsis |FRAME: AT5G04580-MONOMER benzaldehyde dehydrogenase / benzaldehyde oxidase| lacks any discernable targeting signal and thus likely resides in the cytosol |CITS: [19297586]| may further complicate efforts to study the compartmentalization of this pathway.

/<b>General Background</b>
/
/In cassava, rapid post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD) causes significant losses for farmers each year. Cassava is an important staple food crop in developing countries and serves as the second highest source of calories in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, around a quarter of the annual cassava crop can be lost due to PPD in Africa  |CITS: [21526968]|. Therefore, efforts are underway to characterize the biochemical pathways that contribute to PPD. The formation of scopolin,scopoletin, esculin, and esculetin begins in cassava plants shortly after they are cut and there is strong evidence that scopoletin contributes to the deterioration of cassava tubers |CITS: [WHEATLY85] [HUANG01]|.
/
/|FRAME: SCOPOLETIN Scopoletin| (7-hydroxy-6-methoxy coumarin) is a hydroxycoumarin. It is found in a number of plant species including Arabidopsis, cassava, sweet potato, sunflower, cotton and tobacco |CITS: [19004461], [18547395]|. Scopoletin is thought to be involved in plant defense responses. In tobacco, accumulation of scopoletin was shown to strongly correlate with tobacco mosaic virus-induced localized acquired resistance |CITS: [12060240]|. Scopoletin appears to have many pharmacological effects as well, such as antidepressant |CITS: [20599906]|, anti-arthritic |CITS: [21078410]|,and anti-gastro-esophageal inflammatory |CITS: [21163341]|. It may also help to ameliorate insulin resistance |CITS: [20886413]| treat of hypertriglyceridemia |CITS: [17786283]|. In addition, it was also shown to have antitermite activity |CITS: [20563628]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Despite the importance of this pathway for plant and human health, many details on the reactions and enzymes involved in scopolin and scopoletin biosynythesis remain unclear, and may differ between different species. The first reaction, presumably catalyzed by a phenylalanine ammonia lyase in cassava, is likely found in all species. However, the downstream reactions including hydroxylations, isomerizations, etc., are generally less-well characterized and likely less conserved. For instance, genetic and biochemical evidence in Arabidopsis support the conclusion that in this species scopoletin is derived from feruloyl-CoA, not ferulate |CITS: [18547395]|, as shown in the |FRAME: PWY-6792| parthway. However, experiments carried out using isotopically labeled substrates did not reveal a CoA dependence for scopolin biosynthesis in cassava as depicted in this pathway |CITS: [19004461]|.
/
/At least three different biosynthetic routes for scopolin have been suggested |CITS: [19004461]| however, isotopic feeding experiments reveal that the dominant pathway for scopolin biosynthesis proceeds through |FRAME: FERULIC-ACID|. In contrast, esculetin and esculin are primarily made via 2'4'-dihydroxycinnamate. Only a small amount of esculetin is methylated to form scopoletin in |FRAME: TAX-3983| |CITS: [19004461]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/It is well known that |FRAME:TAX-562| can use glucose as a sole source of carbon and energy.  The D isomer of glucose is widely found in nature and the |FRAME: GLC| anomer is predominant in aqueous solution |CITS: [FRANKS87]|.  Exogenous |FRAME: GLC| enters the cell through outer membrane porins and is then actively transported into the cell via the inner membrane phosphotransferase system (PTS) which transforms it into |FRAME: GLC-6-P| as it crosses the cell membrane.  |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is also produced biosynthetically during gluconeogenesis.  |FRAME: GLC-6-P| is one of the basic precursor metabolites for biosynthetic pathways.  It is also a substrate for the central degradative pathways glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle.
/
/|FRAME:TAX-562| can also grow on exogenously supplied glucose-1-phosphate (minimal medium containing glucose 1-phosphate) as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]|.  Endogenous |FRAME: GLC-1-P| is an intermediate in the metabolism of |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| and |FRAME: D-Galactose|.  It is a building block for the sugar nucleotide |FRAME: CPD-12575|, which is used in some biosynthetic pathways.   Reviewed by Mayer, C. and W. Boos in |CITS: [ecosal]| (see below).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The dashed line connecting |FRAME: D-Glucose| with |FRAME: GLC| is meant to show that the pathway is possible, but incompletely defined.  The anomeric form (&alpha; or &beta;) of the |FRAME: D-Glucose| product of EC 3.1.3.10 is not specified by the EC and it was not found in the literature for the indicated phosphatases.  However, if |FRAME: ALPHA-GLUCOSE| is produced, it may either spontaneously convert to |FRAME: GLC|, or |FRAME:TAX-562| aldose-1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) could convert it to |FRAME: GLC| |CITS: [7966338]| and in |CITS: [4711601]|.
/
/Substrates |FRAME: GLC| and |FRAME: GLC-1-P| may be derived from exogenous sources, or endogenously produced, as indicated by the input pathway links.  In general, the ability to utilize sugars and their modes of utilization are strain-dependent in |FRAME:TAX-562|.
/
/Exogenous |FRAME: GLC| uptake via the PTS curbs the utilization of other exogenous sugars, which is known as the glucose effect.  This effect is lost if |FRAME: GLC| becomes limiting.  Under these conditions |FRAME: GLC| can also enter the cell without phosphorylation, via outer membrane porins and the Mgl ABC transporter (not shown).
/
/Endogenous |FRAME: GLC| can be produced by pathways for the degradation of glucose-containing disaccharides such as |FRAME: MALTOSE| (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|) |FRAME: TREHALOSE|, |FRAME: Alpha-lactose| and |FRAME: MELIBIOSE|, as shown in the pathway links.  In contrast to exogenous |FRAME: GLC|  which is phosphorylated by the PTS, endogenous |FRAME: GLC| is phosphorylated by glucokinase before entering central metabolism, as shown in the pathway links (in |CITS: [9023215]|).  More recently, a role for glucokinase and glucose in a complex regulatory mechanism for maltose utilization involving Glk, MalT, Mlc and PtsG has been proposed |CITS: [19028900]|.
/
/It is possible that high levels of |FRAME: GLC| could accumulate inside the cell under certain conditions.  It has been shown that the maltose acetyltransferase product of gene <i>maa</i> efficiently acetylates both maltose and |FRAME: GLC| (not shown).  Evidence suggests that acetylation could be a detoxification mechanism in which acetylated |FRAME: GLC| diffuses from the cell |CITS: [7012137] [1856235]|. 
/
/There is evidence that |FRAME: GLC| can be oxidized to |FRAME: GLC-D-LACTONE| (glucono-&delta;-lactone) by inner membrane glucose dehydrogenase.  However, the fate of the |FRAME: GLC-D-LACTONE| remains unclear.  It has been reported that membrane vesicles from glucose-grown |FRAME:TAX-562| oxidized glucose to gluconate in the presence of |FRAME: PQQ|, a cofactor for glucose dehydrogenase |CITS: [3926746]|.  A gluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.17) has been partially characterized in |FRAME:TAX-562|, but its |FRAME: GLUCONATE| product was not specifically identified |CITS: [4625870]| and no gene encoding this enzyme has been identified.  |FRAME: GLUCONATE| can be degraded by a glucose utilization pathway that was described early |CITS: [14882337]|, as shown in the pathway link.  In addition, more recent work suggested possible excretion of |FRAME: GLUCONATE| although this compound was not specifically identified |CITS: [20215780]|.
/
/|FRAME: GLC-1-P| is reversibly converted by phosphoglucomutase to |FRAME: ALPHA-GLC-6-P|.  |FRAME: GLC-1-P| is used in glycogen biosynthesis (see |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|) and is produced during glycogen degradation (see |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|).  |FRAME: ALPHA-GLC-6-P| may spontaneously convert to |FRAME: GLC-6-P| in the physiological pH range |CITS: [14275652]|.  In addition, a glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase had been identified in |FRAME:TAX-562| ATCC 9637 that could catalyze this production of |FRAME: GLC-6-P|.
/
/Several phosphatases may catalyze the production of |FRAME: D-Glucose| (anomeric form unspecified) from |FRAME: GLC-1-P|.  The product of gene <i>agp</i> is a periplasmic enzyme that scavenges glucose and allows |FRAME:TAX-562| to grow with glucose-1-phosphate as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]| and in |CITS: [12782623]|.

TYPES - Energy-Metabolism
COMMON-NAME - Rubisco shunt
CITATIONS - 15592419:EV-EXP:3443975436:akarthik
COMMENT - Oil is a major carbon reserve in most plant seeds. Conversion of carbohydrates to oil is generally 
/achieved by |FRAME:GLYCOLYSIS| and |FRAME:PWY-1042|. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, is further decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA, 
/the precursor for fatty acid and oil biosynthesis. However, in the process, one-third of carbon is lost as 
/CO2. An elegant experiment recently reported by Schwender et. al.|CITS: [15592419]|, illustrated the existence of a 
/Rubisco shunt. Comparing to glycolysis, the Rubisco shunt results in an increase of carbon conversion 
/efficiency, yielding 20% more acetyl-CoA with 40% less carbon loss. They further showed that in 
/oilseed rape, the Rubisco shunt is responsible for the production of 37% -75% of phosphoglycerate 
/in the developing embryo. There are three stages in the Rubisco shunt. 
/
/Stage I is composed of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (in reverse direction of what is 
/shown in |FRAME:NONOXIPENT-PWY|), where a series re-arrangement of carbon skeleton converts the six-carbon sugar 
/fructose-6-phosphate to the five-carbon sugar ribulose-5-phosphate. Ribulose-5-phosphate is further 
/converted to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. The net change is: 
/5 fructose-6-phosphate = 6 ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
/
/Stage II is catalyzed by the carboxylase activity of Rubisco, which fixes one molecule CO2 with one 
/molecule ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate yielding two molecules three-carbon phosphoglycerate. The net 
/change is: 
/6 ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate + 6 CO2 = 12 phosphoglycerate
/
/In stage III,   phosphoglycerate is converted to pyruvate via the later steps of glycolysis. Pyruvate is 
/further metabolized to acetyl-CoA which fuels fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME:PWY-4381| and seed 
/oil (|FRAME:TRIGLSYN-PWY|) accumulation. The net change is: 
/12 phosphoglycerate = 12 acetyl-CoA + 12 CO2
/
/Overall, the net carbon stoichiometry via Rubisco shunt is:
/5 fructose-6-phosphate = 12 acetyl-CoA + 6 CO2
/
/Comparing to glycolysis:
/5 fructose-6-phosphate = 10 acetyl-CoA + 10 CO2
/
/Thus Rubisco shunt allows the conversion of carbohydrate into 20% more acetyl-CoA than glycolysis, 
/and has 40% less carbon loss as CO2.
/
/Note that there is no active |FRAME:CALVIN-PWY| following the Rubisco step in developing seeds. This 
/allows the continuation of Rubisco shunt to stage III.
/
/The whole pathway is located in the plastid.

CITATIONS - 18702669:EV-EXP-IDA:3431260095:akarthik
COMMENT - The 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), a nitroaromatic explosive, is a highly persistent, organic pollutant, introduced 
/into the environment from the industries involved in the manufacture, packaging, use and decommissioning of 
/explosives. It is a primary target for remediation because of its toxicity (it is a designated class-C carcinogen) 
/and the global extent of environmental contamination. Phytoremidiation is emerging as a viable alternative 
/strategy to the current methods. With their extensive root system, plants have a remarkable ability to extract 
/compounds from their surroundings.  Although several studies have investigated the tolerance of plants to TNT 
/and the active uptake of TNT by plant roots has been demonstrated |CITS: [Pavlostathis98]|, very little is known about the 
/molecular and biochemical basis of its detoxification in the plants. A recent study has demonstrated the 
/reductive transformation of TNT to give hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene (HADNT), and then aminodinitrotoluene (ADNT) 
/and their glucosides |CITS: [18702669]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses |CITS: [11997379]|. ROS are unstable and extremely reactive, the chemical reactivity induces lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation/degradation |CITS: [10638941]|. The effect of ROS on cell fate depends on the level at which they are present.
/
/There are three main types of ROS: |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| arises from the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is constitutively present in cells; |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| arises from dismutation of |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| or the action of oxidase enzymes; and highly reactive |FRAME: CPD-12377| produced from the decomposition of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|, modifies purine and pyrimidine bases and cause DNA strand breaks |CITS: [24511533]|. 
/
/ROS levels in moderation have a normal physiological role in health, controlling inflammatory and immune responses and participating in signal transduction. However, unbalanced levels of ROS are related to many disorders, including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary diseases, diabetes, aging and cancer. 
/
/Most aerobic organisms have developed defense systems to scavenge oxidative radicals and combat oxidative stress, in the form of enzymes that can detoxify ROS. Since ROS can be found in any compartment of the eukaryotic cell, organisms have developed small gene families encoding specific enzymes that operate in the various cell compartments |CITS: [9765550][9214587]|.
/
/
/<b>About this Pathway</b>
/
/The superoxide dismutases (SODs) represent the first line of defense against ROS, converting |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| radicals to |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and water |CITS: [2853161]|. SODs are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor. There are manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SODs, which differ not only in their metal cofactor but also in their subcellular location. Human |FRAME: CPLX66-541| is found in the mitochondrion and is structurally very similar to bacterial FeSODs. 
/
/The |FRAME: CPLX66-540| operates in the cytosol and the |FRAME: CPLX66-542| operates outside the cell. Both are structurally different from |FRAME: CPLX66-541| because of the different electrical properties of copper in comparison to manganese, which results in a major structural change in the protein |CITS: [11997379]|. 
/
/Hydrogen peroxide can be converted to water and/or oxygen by the glutathione peroxidases or catalase |CITS: [10666617]|. Catalases are found in the peroxisome. Through the glutathione peroxidases, this pathway is connected to |FRAME: PWY-4081|. Hydrogen peroxide can also spontaneously form |FRAME: CPD-12377|. The hydroxyl radical cannot be eliminated by an enzymatic reaction and is neutralized by the action of antioxidants such as |FRAME: ASCORBATE|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales, 
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family. 
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many 
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard.
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan 
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on 
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different glucosinolates, 
/of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine (range from homomethionine 
/to hexahomomethionine) (compare |FRAME:PWYQT-4450 aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, side chain elongation cycle|). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among 
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Glycine betaine (<i>N,N,N</i>-trimethylglycine) is a very efficient osmolyte found in a wide range of bacteria and plants, where it is accumulated at high cytoplasmic concentrations in response to osmotic stress, to act as an osmoprotectant. In addition to its osmoprotectant activity, glycine betaine is also a potent protectant against mutagenic compounds |CITS: [12730887][15802867]| and radiation-induced damage |CITS: [12841603]|.
/
/Glycine betaine can either be taken up directly from the environment, or synthesized. A common biosynthesis pathway for glycine betaine is from choline, utilizing a two-step pathway with betaine aldehyde as intermediate. This pathway is conserved in bacteria and plants, but shows divergence in the enzymes involved. Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and higher plants all use a betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.8) to catalyze the conversion of betaine aldehyde to glycine betaine. The choline-to-betaine aldehyde reaction, however, is divergent: Gram-negative bacteria such as <i>|FRAME:TAX-562|, |FRAME:TAX-287|</i>, and |FRAME:TAX-382| utilize a choline dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.1) (see |FRAME: BETSYN-PWY|), Gram-positive bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-1423|, use an alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (see |FRAME: PWY-3722|), while high plants use a choline monooxygenase (EC 1.14.15.7)
/(this pathway).
/
/Certain Gram-positive bacteria, such as |FRAME:TAX-1677| and |FRAME:TAX-1665|, as well as the fungus <i>Cylindrocarpon didymun</i>, use yet another enzyme to catalyze this conversion: they use a soluble choline oxidase that catalyzes both steps (see |FRAME: PWY-3721|).
/
/There exists at least one more variation for the synthesis of glycine betaine, which is found in several halotolerant bacteria. The pathway was found in |FRAME: TAX-1052 "<i>Halorhodospira halochloris</i> (previously known as <i>Ectothiorhodospira halochloris</I>)"| and several other organisms, which synthesize glycine betaine from glycine through a series of methylation reactions |CITS: [10896953]| (see |FRAME: P541-PWY|). However, since methylation reactions are among the most energy-consuming processes in nature  (the regeneration of one active methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine costs the cell 12 ATP equivalents), it is not surprising that this pathway is less common.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Glycine betain biosynthesis in plants differs from that in bacteria and animal. Plants convert choline to betaine aldehyde by the activity of choline monooxygenase, a Rieske type iron-sulfur-containing enzyme, whereas bacteria and animals catalyze this reaction utilizing either choline dehydrogenase or choline oxidase.
/
/The two enzymes of this pathway have been characterized in plants including spinach and sugar beet. |FRAME:TAX-3701| is generally considered a non-glycine betaine accumulating plant |CITS: [12192001]|, yet data suggests the endogenous glycine betaine level can be induced by cold acclimation and water stress |CITS: [11378169]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>
/
/Maintenance of genomic and transcriptomic integrity is a vital goal of all organisms. Cells are often subjected to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as |FRAME: CPD-12377 hydroxyl radical|,  that can arise from due to oxidative stress, ionizing radiation, and certain aspects of normal cellular metabolism. These ROS can modify nucletide bases and cause problems during DNA replication and RNA transcription. This damage can occur on free nucleotides or in the context of DNA or RNA macromolecules. Organisms have evolved several strategies for trying to combat the damage that can be caused by oxidative stress, including this pathway that is involved in eliminating a source of potentially mutagenic nucleotides before they can be used for DNA replication or mRNA transcription |CITS: [ROGACHEVA08]|.
/
/Oxidation of the free |FRAME: GTP GTP| and |FRAME: DGTP dGTP| can occur spontaneously in cells when a hydroxyl radical attacks the C8 position of the purine base guanine |CITS: [16863995]|. If the |FRAME: CPD0-1905 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-dGTP| is incorporated into DNA, it can mispair with a C or an A and lead to G:C ->T:A or A:T -> C:G transversions respectively,  although the A:T to C:G transversion seems to be more common <i>in vivo</i> (|CITS: [1309939] [ROGACHEVA08]|). Similarly, an |FRAME: CPD-12366 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-GTP| can be incorrectly incorporated opposite an adenosine residue during RNA transcription |CITS: [17804481]|. To prevent these errors, a Nudix hydrolase acts to remove a pyrophophate group from the oxidized nucelotides, thus, rendering them incompetent for incorporation into DNA or RNA |CITS: [ROGACHEVA08]|. It is important to note that there is evidence from humans that |FRAME: CPD-12365 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-dGMP| cannot be re-phosphorylated by the guanylate kinase enzyme |CITS: [7819228]|. 
/
/Oxidized (d)GTP appears to be a potentially major source of genetic lesions. Both mutant <i>E.coli</i> and eukaryotes show marked increases in DNA and RNA errors when this pathway is blocked . And the errors caused by the failure of this pathway may be linked to cancer and other DNA-damage related diseases  |CITS: [1309939][17804481][ROGACHEVA08]|. 
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/The ROS-induced steps shown in this pathway occur spontaneously. The subsequent de-toxification of the damaged free nucleotides is carried out by the members of the Nudix family of hydrolases. MutT from E.coli was the first characterized protein shown to have this protective pyrophosphatase activity |CITS: [9311918]|. Homologs of this protein have been functionally characterized in species as distantly related as humans |CITS: [1332067]|, the yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> |CITS: [15475388]| , and Arabidopsis plants |CITS: [15878881][17804481]| suggesting that this is a widely conserved pathway for preventing genomic and transcriptomic errors in the presence of ROS.
/
/In humans, |FRAME: CPD-12365 "8-oxo-dGMP"| is further degraded to |FRAME: CPD-12381 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine| which can exit through the cell membrane, and end up in the urine where it is used as a diagnostic measurement of oxidative stress |CITS: [7819228]|. It is unclear what downstream steps are used to remove or recycle |FRAME: CPD-12367 "8-oxo-GMP"| or |FRAME: CPD-12365 "8-oxo-dGMP"| in other organisms.

/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  
/
/Lutein is a xanthophyll carotenoid abundant in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, but also
/found in other organisms.
/Lutein is used as an antioxidant and for blue light absorption. In some fruits and flowers, such as marigolds
/lutein is covalently bound to one or more fatty acids.
/In animals lutein is found in egg yolks, fats and the corpus luteum (endocrine structure in mammals,
/involved in the production of the progestogens during pregnancy). It is also found in a concentrated area
/of the macula, a small area of the retina responsible for central vision.
/
/Lutein is produced from |FRAME: CPD1F-115| in three steps via |FRAME: CPD1F-118| and

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (see |FRAME:PWY1F-467|, |FRAME:PWY-361|) generates a multitude of compounds involved in structural integrity, plant defense and interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment |CITS:[20035037]|. It is also the gateway to a number of phenylpropanoid derivatives, for instance flavonoids which fulfill important roles in the reproduction and survival of plants. The model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> represents the most thoroughly researched plant in terms of elucidating the biosynthetic routes, enzymes, encoding genes and regulatory aspects of the diverse compound classes originating from the basic phenylpropanoids |CITS:[Fraser11] [Saito13]|. Descendants of this compounds, e.g. simple anthocyanins are often further modified by sequential hydroxylation, methylation, glucosylation and acylation which often results in complex anthocyanin structures such as the main anthocyanin found in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, i.e. |FRAME:CPD-16540| |CITS:[11830144]|. Such modifications are discussed as metabolic events which may alter light-absorption properties, stabilize pigments, effect water solubility, lower enzymatic degradation and enhance their bioavailability in diet |CITS:[Tanaka06] [Strack94]|.
/
/The pathway depicted above describes the biosynthetic route of this compound also referred to as A11 according to the classification of |CITS:[15807784]|. Although the various steps leading to A11 have been enzymatically characterized and the reaction sequence is supported by experimental data certain modifications may still occur in a different order, for instance the xylosylation |CITS:[21899608]| or early acylation |CITS:[17425720]| of |FRAME:CPD1F-766| which is illustrated by the fork in the pathway which eventually merges into the formation of |FRAME:CPD-16536|. Nevertheless, in general the biosynthetic route to A11 is thought to proceed in a defined order rather than in a network of reactions |CITS:[17425720]|.
/
/Oftentimes enzymes catalyzing modification steps in secondary metabolism are characterized by broad substrate specificity and may not be identifiable through sequence homology which requires variegated approaches including transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses |CITS:[17425720] [15807784] [17292360] [15908604]|. The xylosylation at C-2" and the coumaryolation at C-6" appear to be the first modifications of |FRAME:CPD1F-766| because |FRAME:CPD-7138| is not a suitable acceptor for the corresponding cyanidin 2"-xylosyltransferase |CITS:[21899608]| and cyanidin 6"-coumaroyltransferase |CITS:[17425720]|. Following the 5-<i>O</i>-glucosylation of |FRAME:CPD-16536| |CITS:[15807784]| malonysation of the 5-<i>O</i>glucose moiety is next because the cyanidin 5-<i>O</i>-glucoside 6"-<i>O</i>-malonyltransferase (5MaT) does not accept more advanced modified cyanide where the coumaroyl group has been further glucosylated |CITS:[17292360]|. <i>In vivo</i> experiments with <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutants with a knocked out serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) enzyme that catalyzes sinapoylation indicate that this is the second to last step in the A11 formation |CITS:[17600138]| which biosynthesis is finalized by an acylglucose dependent anthocyanin glucosyltransferase |CITS:[23298714]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Saponins are glycosides of triterpenoid (this pathway) or steroidal aglycones (see |FRAME:PWY-2541|) with a varying number of sugar side chains. Saponins are especially enriched in plant epidermal cells forming a protective surfactant that forms a soapy froth when mixed with water |CITS: [12188349]|.
/Found among a wide variety of plants legumes constitute a major source of saponins |CITS: [WALLER96B]| |CITS: [12644640]|. The saponins isolated from soybean and other legumes, also referred to as soyasaponins, are derived from triterpenoid aglycones such as soyasapogenol A, B, E, medicagenic acid, hederagenin and bayogenin which have been identified through metabolic profiling |CITS: [11830145]|.
/
/Saponins possess a number of biological activities that have been intensively investigated over the last few decades. Extracts of plants rich on saponins have been demonstrated to have allelopathic, antiflammatory, hemolytic |CITS: [WALLER96B]|, cholesterol lowering |CITS: [SAUVAIRE96]| |CITS: [10540988]| and anticancer properties |CITS: [15134504]| but are also known to reduce the digestibility in ruminants |CITS: [ 8726748][CHEEKE96][10552705]| and to be generally toxic to cold blooded animals and insects |CITS: [TAVA96]|.
/
/The diversity in conjugation of saponins increases the biological activity of those compounds compared to their aglycone (sapogenin) complements |CITS: [11344312]|. In addition, saponin has been successfully tested as a cleaning agent for remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils |CITS: [12365835]|. However, the physiological significance of saponins in plants remains poorly understood and requires further research.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first committed step in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins is the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene, a common intermediate in the biosynthesis of terpenoids that marks both a branching point for phytosterols and triterpenoid biosyntheses |CITS: [11510484]| and primary (sterols) and secondary (triterpenoids) metabolism |CITS: [9746369]|. The reaction is carried out by a specific oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), i.e. &beta;-amyrin synthase (bAS) that catalyzes the formation of &beta;-amyrin and is inducible upon treatment with methyljasmonate |CITS: [12721381]|. &beta;-amyrin is the central compound that represents another branch point in the saponin biosynthesis and can be converted into at least five different triterpenoid aglycones in legumes |CITS: [12492844]|.The cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene can generate more than 80 different skeleton types leading to tetra- and pentacyclic compounds via multiple (8-10) asymmetric centres 
/in one single enzymatic step |CITS: [14751299]|. That clearly indicates the high stereospecificity of the enzyme involved in a series of intermediate reactions which mechanism has been thoroughly investigated |CITS: [9746369]|.
/
/The further decoration of &beta;-amyrin towards the synthesis of soyasaponins involves hydroxylation and glycosylation reactions. In analogy to a series of similar oxidative reactions involved in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids (|FRAME:PWY-699|, |FRAME:PWY-2582|) the involvement of cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases have been expected for the formation of soysaponin |CITS: [12644640]| |CITS: [14751299]|.
/Just recently the characterization of a 24-hydroxylase being able to hydroxylate both &beta;-amyrin to form olean-12-ene-3beta,24-diol and sophoradiol to generate soyasapogenol B has been reported |CITS: [16478469]|.
/The other steps of the pathway (C-22-hydroxylation) leading to soyasapogenol and/or relevant intermediates are also anticipated to be carried out by cytochrome P450's.
/
/The remaining reaction of the pathway concerns the attachment of glycosidic residues to the sapogenin, leading to the formation of a saponin. The first step is the attachemnt of &beta;-glucuronate, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-7612|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: MONOMER-12198| (UGASGT). This is followed by attachment of &beta;-galactose and L-rhamnose, forming |FRAME: CPD-13255| |CITS: [20350545]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate (hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate) in plant cells.  Phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth.  It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) known as phytin |CITS:[11590064],[8744268]|.  Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin |CITS:[15700415]|.  Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see |CITS:[14568069]|).  The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties.  Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract.  Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption.  Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution |CITS:[11590064],[11906835]|.  Currently, little is known of the biosynthesis of phytate.  There appears to be several routes of synthesis: a lipid-dependent route which uses Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> produced from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis by phospholipase C, and a lipid-independent route relying on the phosphorylation of <i>myo</i>-inositol or Ins(3)P.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>  To date the biosynthesis of phytate following this pathway has only been fully reported in the aquatic monocotyledonous plant <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i> |CITS:[8660287]| and differs from that reported in the slime mould <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> (which goes via Ins(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> instead of Ins(3,4,6)P<sub>3</sub> in this pathway).  The sequence of conversions from Ins(3)P<sub>1</sub> to phytate has been evidenced by feeding radiolabeled inositol phosphates to <i>Spirodela polyrhiza</i>.  No enzymes are available for this organism.  Several enzymes have been characterized in maize where this pathway is likely to occur |CITS:[15237968], [12586875], [15918884]|.  Ins(3)P<sub>1</sub> can be obtained from two different routes: the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate or <i>myo</i>-inositol.  The first reaction is performed by an Ins(3)P<sub>1</sub> synthase (MIPS) |CITS:[15237968]|.  The second reaction is catalyzed by a <i>myo</i>-inositol kinase |CITS:[15918884]|.  The enzymes allowing the conversion of Ins(3)P<sub>1</sub> to phytate in this pathway have not been characterized in great detail as yet.  However a <i>myo</i>-inositol polyphosphate kinase has been detected in maize which phosphorylates Ins(3,4,5,6)P<sub>4</sub>.  Unfortunately, the exact nature of the kinase activity of this enzyme is not yet know as the reaction product have not been characterized |CITS:[12586875]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-10678 Avenacin| is an antifungal saponin in which the aglycones are |FRAME: CPD-6948|-derived pentacyclic triterpenoids esterified with either N-methylanthranilic acid or benzoic acid. The sugar unit is a branched trisaccharide. They are found exclusively in |FRAME: TAX-4496 "<i>Avena</i> (oat)"| roots and have been implicated in the resistance of |FRAME: TAX-4496| seedlings to the fungal soil pathogen <i>Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici</i>, the causal agent of `take-all' disease of wheat and barley. The pentacyclic triterpenoid part of the avenacins like the tetracyclic triterpenoid ring system of the phytosterols and their conjugates, is formed from mevalonic acid by way of isopentenyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate and 2,3-oxidosqualene. The |FRAME: CPD-10678| and phytosterol pathways then diverge with the cyclization of |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| to form the |FRAME: CPD-6948| needed for |FRAME: CPD-10678| biosynthesis and the cycloartenol needed for phytosterol biosynthesis. 
/
/
/The formation of |FRAME: CPD-10678| from |FRAME: CPD-6948| requires: (i) extensive oxyfunctionalization of the pentacyclic triterpenoid nucleus of |FRAME: CPD-6948|, (ii) esterification of the partly or fully functionalized |FRAME: CPD-6948| nucleus with either |FRAME:CPD-402|, which forms |FRAME: CPD-10678| and |FRAME:CPD-16597| or |FRAME:BENZOATE| which generates |FRAME: CPD-16599| and |FRAME:CPD-16598|, respectively |CITS: [10872206 ] [23532069]|.

COMMENT - Phospholipids are the major structural components of biological membranes in plants, animals, and 
/yeasts. In plants, phospholipids predominate extra-chloroplast membranes including the plasma 
/membrane, mitochondria membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomal membrane, with 
/phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine being the major constituents. Phospholipids are 
/mostly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once synthesized, they are transported to 
/other phospholipid containing membranes.
/
/There are at least three different pathways contribute to phosphatidylserine biosynthesis, the 
/decarboxylation pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5669|), the phosphoethanolamine transfer pathway (depicted here), 
/and the base (head group) exchange reaction (|FRAME: RXN-1382|). The phosphoethanolamine transfer pathway 
/(this one) is believed to be the major pathway in phosphatidylserine biosynthesis.

COMMENT - Farnesenes are a group of closely related sesquiterpenoids and occur as &alpha;- and &beta;- isomers. 
/The &alpha;-farnesene can exist in four isomeric forms, |FRAME: CPD-8764|, (E,Z), (Z,Z), and

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE|  (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent
/findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well |CITS: [15003233]|. In animals and plants GABA is produced by the cytosolic enzyme |FRAME: GLUTDECARBOX-RXN "glutamate decarboxylase"|.
/
/The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|. Diiferent variants of both enzymes are known. The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]|) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862| |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|). Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirement, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.
/
/The action of glutamate decarboxylase, &gamma;-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and succinate semialdehyde
/dehydrogenase, combined, defines a short pathway known as the "GABA shunt", since it can channel glutamate into the |FRAME: TCA|, bypassing two steps of that cycle.  
/
/While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capabillity to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria can synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation "putrescine degradation"|). 
/The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|
/|CITS:[13654294][13654295]|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source |CITS: [8951816][12123465]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This variant of the pathway includes a |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase.
/This combination of enzymes has been documented in bacteria and animals and in some plants.
/
/The  transaminase found in animals and bacteria utilizes |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]|). While this form of enzyme appears to be a minor form in plants, studies of ripening tomatoes have shown that in this plant |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent activity is significantly higher (4200 times) than |FRAME:PYRUVATE|-dependent activity |CITS: [18713763]|.
/
/Regarding the hydrogenase, NAD-specific variant have been studied from many bacteria, plant and animals |CITS: [6995433][18713763][3190233]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: SUCROSE Sucrose| is the major product of photosynthesis in most plants and is known to be essential for their growth, development, carbon storage, signal transduction and stress protection |CITS: [11005202]|.
/Sucrose is also found in cyanobacteria, and the ability to synthesize sucrose is a widespread feature of these organisms |CITS: [21054739]|. In addition, sucrose is produced by many nonphotosynthetic aerobic methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria |CITS: [1055047][12656177][14529181][23808151][23865613]|.
/
/In photosynthetic organisms, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation (|FRAME: GAP|) is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm, where it is transformed to |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| by enzymes of the |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY gluconeogenesis| pathway. In plants, |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| is used to synthesize sucrose, the form in which most fixed organic carbon is translocated from photosynthetic tissue to non-photosynthetic organs. Sucrose also provides substrates for plant storage glycosides such as |FRAME: Starch starch| and |FRAME: Fructans fructans|. Storage glycosides, including sucrose, are mobilized and utilized during seed germination and plant growth.
/
/In marine and freshwater cyanobacteria, sucrose fulfils a different role. It is often synthesized in response to salt or temperature stress and seems to maintain the osmotic balance and to stabilize protein and membrane structure and function |CITS: [Reed86][7854254]|. Methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria also synthesize sucrose as a secondary osmotic compound, along with the major compatible solute |FRAME: ECTOINE| (see |FRAME: PWY-7347|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Sucrose synthesis is performed by generating the phosphorylated form, |FRAME: SUCROSE-6P| (the "F" indicates that the phosphate group is attached to the furanose moiety), followed by dephosphorylation. The first step is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.14|, which condenses |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| with |FRAME: CPD-12575|. The second step is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.24|, which hydrolyzes |FRAME: SUCROSE-6P| to |FRAME: SUCROSE|.
/In photosynthetic organisms both precursors originate from photosynthetic-derived carbon, via |FRAME: FRUCTOSE-6P| |CITS: [20026474]|.
/
/Most plant possess another enzyme that can form sucrose - |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.13|. However, the name of this enzyme is misleading, since it has been shown that under most physiological conditions it catalyzes a sucrose cleavage reaction, and is thus involved in sucrose degradation |CITS: [plantbiochemistry97]| (see |FRAME: PWY-3801|).

/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the most common route in which pyrimidine ribonucleotides (|FRAME: CDP| and |FRAME: UDP|) are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, and the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed. It is found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
/
/Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides at the C2' position, which in this pathway is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 "EC 1.17.4.1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase"|. Since this enzyme, which plays a central role in DNA replication and repair, can only perform the reduction of nucleoside-diphosphates, the conversion of the product of <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, |FRAME: UMP|, to a deoxyuridine form requires phosphorylation to |FRAME: UDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DUDP|. Likewise, reduction of the first cytidine-nucleotide that is formed <i>de novo</i>, |FRAME: CTP|, to a deoxycytidine form requires dephosphorylation to |FRAME: CDP| followed by reduction to |FRAME: DCDP|.
/
/Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.45 "thymidylate synthase, EC 2.1.1.45"| (some organisms have an alternative enzyme, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6545|).
/The enzyme only accepts the mono-phosphorylated form |FRAME: DUMP|. Thus, the first deoxyuridine nucleotide that is formed, |FRAME: DUDP|, needs to be converted to the monophosphate form before it can be reduced/methylated. This is achieved in two steps - phosphorylation to |FRAME: DUTP|, followed by the removal of a diphosphate group, resulting in |FRAME: DUMP|.
/
/Once |FRAME: TMP| is formed, two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: HS11384-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the broad substrate range enzyme |FRAME: CPLX66-1052|.
/
/In organisms that contain the enzyme |FRAME: DCTP-DEAM-CPLX| (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.13 EC 3.5.4.13"|), a second route forms |FRAME: DUMP| from |FRAME: DCDP| (see |FRAME: PWY-7187|).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/In plants, the major prenylquinones are plastoquinone and ubiquinone. Although both prenylquinones share the structural
/feature of the trans-polyprenyl tail attached to a benzoquinone skeleton, their subcellular localization and biochemical roles
/are distinct.  Ubiquinone exists in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, and transfers electrons from the NADH
/dehydrogenase complex to the cytochrome b-c<sub>1</sub> complex in the respiratory chain reaction 
/(see |FRAME:PWY-3781|).  In addition to their function in electron transfer, both plasto- and ubiquinone, in reduced form,
/are involved in antioxidant activity |CITS:[2352956],[7503545]|.  Although |FRAME:UBIQUINONE-9| is known to be synthesized
/in <i>Arabidopsis</i> very little is known concerning the different biosynthetic steps involved.
/
/The pathway presented here is based on a eukaryotic ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis pathway that has been studied in other
/organisms.
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier
/in membranes.
/In eukaryotes ubiquinone is found mostly within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it functions
/in respiratory electron transport, transferring two electrons from either complex I (NADH dehydrogenase)
/or complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) to complex III (<i>bc</i><sub>1</sub> complex).
/The quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from |FRAME: 4-hydroxybenzoate|, while the
/isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are synthesized via the |FRAME: NONMEVIPP-PWY|,
/which feeds isoprene units into the |FRAME: Polyprenyl-Biosynthesis| pathways.
/
/The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain vary in different species. For example,
/|FRAME: TAX-559292| has 6 such subunits, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, rat and mouse have 9, and
/|FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10. The ubiquinones are often named according to the number of carbons in
/the side chain (e.g. ubi-30) or the number of isoprenoid subunits (e.g. Q-10).
/
/Following addition of the polyprenyl tail, the product (4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate), is processed
/in three steps, namely decarboxylation, oxidation, and methylation. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic
/pathways differ in the order of these steps: in eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated
/prior to decarboxylation; in prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation
/and methylation |CITS: [Shepherd96]|.
/
/The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that
/accumulate pathway intermediates; some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically
/characterized.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: UBIQUINONE-9| (Q-9) has been reported in different types of eukaryotic organisms.
/
/It is the only quinone found in many animals, including the common mammals mouse
/(|FRAME: TAX-10090|) and rat (|FRAME: TAX-10116|), the fish |FRAME: TAX-283036| (walleye), the
/worm |FRAME: TAX-6239| |CITS: [17482885]|, and certain insects, such as the house fly
/(|FRAME: TAX-7370|) and the cabbage white butterfly |FRAME: TAX-64459| |CITS: [13673033]|.
/
/Q-9 is also synthesized by several fungal species. It has been found in the |FRAME: TAX-5204| species
/|FRAME: TAX-200324|, |FRAME:TAX-336994| and |FRAME:TAX-198662| |CITS: [Sugiyama88]|, and the

COMMENT - Glutamate synthase (glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, GOGAT) is an important enzyme involved in 
/ammonia (nitrogen) assimilation. Arabidopsis, like many other plants, has both NADH-dependent and 
/Ferredoxin-dependent GOGAT (Fd-GOGAT). The ferredoxin-dependent GOGAT is the predominant form found in 
/Arabidopsis. There are two genes in Arabidopsis encoding Fd-GOGAT. GLU1 is primarily expressed in the leaves 
/and its expression is induced by light and sucrose, whereas GLU2 is preferentially expressed in roots.  GLU1 plays 
/a major role in assimilating the large amount of ammonia released from photorespiration and is also involved in 
/primary nitrogen assimilation in leaves. GLU2 may be involved in primary nitrogen assimilation in roots.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>:  The metabolism of L-arginine comprises various pathways that overlap and interconnect with each other such as the |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|, |FRAME:PWY-4984| and the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle (this pathway). Nitric oxide (NO), the main product of this cycle, has been established for some time as a unique type of biological messenger in animal cells |CITS:[17513437]|. Moreover, also plants have been shown to produce NO in a variety of biochemical and chemical processes. NO has been reported to play an important role in signal transduction pathways and is included in such vital physiological responses as modulation of hormonal, wounding and defense responses, and regulation of cell death |CITS:[11286923]| |CITS:[15231269]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>:  The biosynthesis of NO in both plants and animals is primarily catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The debate whether or not NOS exists and operates in plants is ongoing. However, a nitric oxide synthase (AtNOS1) producing NO while converting L-arginine to citrulline has been identified and partially characterized in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[14526079]|. Nevertheless, the controversies about the enzyme |CITS:[17030145]| demands further investigation to shed light on biosynthesis and regulation of NO production in plants.  
/
/Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, EC 6.3.4.5) catalyses the condensation of citrulline and aspartate to form argininosuccinate, the immediate precursor of arginine. This enzyme has not yet been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> but the presence of argininosuccinate in Arabidopsis substantiates the existence of the reaction. The final step, the reversible conversion of argininosuccinate to arginate and fumarate catalyzed by the argininosuccinate lyase has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis; the enzyme was partially purified and characterized from Arabidopsis leaves |CITS:[17651442]|. This enzyme, together with argininosuccinate synthetase is also constituent of the arginine biosynthesis and the urea cycle indicating the complex regulation of these pathways in plants.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The glyoxylate cycle is involved primarily in the conversion of lipids into carbohydrates, which occurs in germinating oil seeds (for an overview, see |FRAME:PWY-561|) |CITS:[BROWNLEADER97]|.  This pathway is essentially a modified version of the TCA cycle (see |FRAME:PWY-5690|) that bypasses those steps in the cycle that lead to a loss of CO<sub>2</sub>.  This pathway uses a two-step bypass (compared to the TCA cycle), which converts |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to form |FRAME:SUC| and |FRAME:MAL| via the formation of |FRAME:GLYOX| |CITS:[BROWNLEADER97]|.  The two enzymes responsible for this bypass are isocitrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.1) and malate synthase (EC 2.3.3.9).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straight forward.
/A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.
/
/Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towrds complete mineralization.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In most plants, purine nucleotides are completely degraded to |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE CO<SUB>2</SUB>| and |FRAME: AMMONIA ammonia| via the ureides |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN <i>S</i>-allantoin| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE allantoate|. This degradation proceeds via the intermediates |FRAME: XANTHINE xanthine| and |FRAME: URATE urate|.
/
/The initial step of AMP degradation is the conversion of AMP to IMP, which is converted to xanthine in two alternative routes, via |FRAME: XANTHOSINE xanthosine| or |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE hypoxanthine|. 
/
/The product of this pathway, |FRAME: URATE urate|, is converted to to |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN <i>S</i>-allantoin| as described in |FRAME: PWY-5691 urate degradation to allantoin|.
/
/The plant pathway is very similar to that found in mammals. However, mammals do not have the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-11783 guanosine deaminase| (EC 3.5.4.15) |CITS: [14725335]| (see |FRAME: PWY-6353 purine nucleotides degradation II (aerobic)|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: The pyridine nucleotide NAD and NADP are ubiquitous coenzymes that may 
/have impact on virtually every metabolic pathway in the cell |CITS: [16714307]| |CITS: [MOAT87]|. The biosynthesis of NAD in 
/plants is realized via two major routes the de novo synthesis of NAD (see |FRAME:PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|) 
/and the pyridine nucleotide cycle (this pathway). The name of the latter was coined to summarize the various 
/routes of degradation and salvage of pyridine compounds |CITS: [4306794]|. In dependence on the plant species 
/investigated the pyridine nucleotide cycle may involve a varying number of steps emphasizing the flexibility 
/of this pathway in response to organism-specific and/or environmental conditions |CITS: [Wagner86b]| 
/|CITS: [Zheng04]| |CITS: [15837705]| |CITS: [Ashihara05]|. 
/
/The pyridine nucleotide cycling pathway ensures the homeostatic replenishment of NAD when the coenzyme 
/has been involved in NAD consuming reactions. The pathway is fairly similar to the bacterial variant (|FRAME:PYRIDNUCSAL-PWY|) 
/with the exception that some enzymes, e.g. NMN amidohydrolase, NAD synthase (NH3-dependent) have 
/not been identified in plants, and that plants are capable of by-passing enzymes under certain conditions, 
/hence conferring a broader adaptability |CITS: [16714307]|.  
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The anaplerotic enzyme of the pyridine nucleotide cycle is quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase 
/(QPRtase) (|FRAME:PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|) forming nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) which may be considered 
/as the start compound of this cycle |CITS: [Wagner84]| |CITS: [11198422]|. From there two different routes 
/can be taken to produce nicotinate, an important intermediate that gives rise to several secondary metabolites, 
/e.g. trigonelline. 
/
/The enzyme catalyzing the direct conversion to nicotinate, i.e. NaMN nucleosidase (synonym NaMN glycohydrolase - NaMN-Ghase) 
/has been partially purified from tobacco. The other route comprises several enzymatic steps that include the 
/formation of the main intermediates nicotinate adenine dinucleotide (NaAD), NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) 
/and nicotinamide. The enzyme that catalyzes the final step of the formation of nicotinate from nicotinamide, 
/i.e. nicotinamidase has been identified in several plants |CITS: [Wagner86b]| |CITS: [13790768]| |CITS: [Ashihara05]| 
/|CITS: [15837705]| indicating the main stream of this pathway. The reverse reaction catalyzed by nicotinamide 
/phosphoribosyltransferase (NPRT) has not been detected in plants |CITS: [Hunt04]| |CITS: [15837705]|. The 
/final step closing the cycle by converting nicotinate to nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) is catalyzed by 
/nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (Na-PRtase) |CITS: [Wagner86]| |CITS: [16658750]|. This enzyme 
/expressed a high affinity towards nicotinate but did not accept nicotinamide as its counterpart enzyme in 
/animals |CITS: [Wagner86b]|.
/
/The pathway displays two additional routes that can be taken to form either nicotinamide from NMN or 
/nicotinate mononucleotide (NaMN) from nicotinate. Both form the nucleotide riboside intermediates that are 
/catabolized by 5'-nucleotidase and NMN nucleosidase (via NMN riboside) and nucleoside phosphorylase and 
/nicotinate ribose kinase (via nicotinate riboside), respectively. Some of those activities and the nucleoside
/ribosides have been found in plants |CITS: [16714307]| |CITS: [Hunt04]| |CITS: [15837705]| |CITS: [POLYA75]|
/|CITS: [6295388]| but the enzymes remain to be further characterized.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The TCA pathway is a catabolic pathway of aerobic respiration. It generates energy and reducing power. Respiration is an ATP-generating process in which compounds act as electron donors through a chain of electron transfer to electron acceptors. Aerobic respiration uses oxygen as the final acceptor. Anaerobic respiration uses several organic compounds as acceptors such as fumarate, nitrate and hydrogen. During the chain of electron transfer, protons (H+) are transported outside the cytoplasmic membrane, generating a proton motive force (PMF). Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, the PMF energy is captured as ATP, catalyzed by a multisubunit ATPase |CITS: [15134745]|.
/
/<b> About this pathway </b>
/One of the main differences between the eukaryotic TCA cycle (described in this pathway) and the
/prokaryotic |FRAME: TCA| is that the later contains an alternative route between |FRAME: MAL| and
/|FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: EG12069-MONOMER|
/(EC 1.1.99.16). That enzyme is found in some bacteria, but is absence from most eukaryotes,
/in which the reaction is catalyzed only by the |FRAME: ENSG00000146701-MONOMER| (EC 1.1.1.37).
/
/Another difference concerns the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. Prokaryotes possess only an
/|FRAME: MONOMER-13167| form, which supports both respiration via the TCA cycle
/and glutamate biosynthesis for anabolic reactions.
/Eukaryotes, on the other hand, have two types of the enzyme - NADP-dependent forms (EC 1.1.1.42)
/and NAD-dependent forms (EC 1.1.1.41). It has been shown that the NADP-dependent enzymes are
/involved primarily in glutamate biosynthesis, while the NAD-dependent enzymes are involved in respiration

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Coenzyme A (CoA) is a cofactor of ubiquitous occurrence in plants, bacteria 
/and animals needed in a large number of enzymatic reactions central to intermediary metabolism, including 
/the oxidation of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Coenzyme A is the common acyl carrier in 
/prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells required for a multitude of reactions for both biosynthetic and degradative 
/pathways amongst others forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy metabolism |CITS: [16415216]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of CoA is of equal importance with regard to its recognition as a target for antibacterial 
/drug discovery and to the association of human neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in pantothenate 
/kinase |CITS: [15893380]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: The biosynthesis of CoA is carried out from pantothenate in five enzymatic steps. 
/All of the enzymes involved have been recently identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the metabolic 
/sequence confirmed <i>in vitro</i> by combining the recombinant enzymes |CITS: [12860978]|. 
/
/Pantothenate kinase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step, phosphorylates 4'-phosphopantothenate to 4'-phosphopantothenate 
/followed by the addition of cysteine resulting in the formation of (R)-4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). 
/PPC is decarboxylated in the next reaction to 4'-phosphopantetheine and then in two successive reactions 
/converted to CoA by the enzymatic action of 4'-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase 
/|CITS: [12860978]| |CITS: [12614618]|. The reactions in the biosynthetic route towards CoA parallel the reaction

COMMON-NAME - arginine biosynthesis II (acetyl cycle)
CITATIONS - 16122935

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Arginine biosynthesis is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis, and certain degradative pathways. The initial steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathways proceed via <i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for this is that the acetylation prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis, thus keeping the two pathways separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein). 
/
/At least three alternative arginine biosynthetic pathways have evolved in bacteria:
/
/In the first pathway (|FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY|), which is not very common, the key intermediate |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed by the enzyme |FRAME: N-ACETYLTRANSFER-CPLX|. A second key intermediate downstream, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|, is hydrolyzed by the enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX|, releasing acetate, and forming the arginine precursor |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE||.
/
/In the second pathway (|FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions mentioned above are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto glutamate, regenerating  |FRAME:ACETYL-GLU| (NAG).
/This recycling is performed by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-1001| (OAT). This pathway is considered more evolved, since the overall reaction is energetically more favorable |CITS: [3534538]|.
/
/The third pathway (|FRAME: PWY-5154|) is a variation found in several eubacteria. While in the two pathways mentioned above |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is deacetylate to |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE|, which is subsequntly transcarbamylated to form |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE|, in this variant |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is not deacetylated. Instead, it is transcarbamylated directly by the enzyme acetylornithine transcarbamylase, resulting in |FRAME: CPD-7224|. The enzyme |FRAME:ACETYLORNDEACET-CPLX| can accept |FRAME: CPD-7224| as a substrate,
/and deacetylates it into |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| |CITS: [16585758]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The cyclic pathway for arginine biosynthesis has been demonstrated in many organisms, including the prokaryotes |FRAME:TAX-186817|, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, photosynthetic bacteria and archaebacteria, as well as eukaryotic organisms such as |FRAME:TAX-4932|, |FRAME:TAX-5140| sp., and |FRAME:TAX-3052| sp.
/
/Organisms that employ this pathway possess the <i>argJ</i> gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT). OAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from <i>N</i>-&alpha;-acetyl-ornithine to glutamate,  generating ornithine and <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). Since the latter is the substrate for another enzyme in this pathway, <i>N</i>-acetyl-glutamate kinase (encoded by <i>argB</i>), which catalyzes a previous step, this reaction effectively converts the otherwise linear pathway to a cyclical pathway  |CITS: [JGM138-125][8025667]|.
/While most of the NAG in these organisms is generated by OAT, some of it is still generated by <i>N</i>-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, EC 2.3.1.1, encoded by <i>argA</i>), which fulfils an anaplerotic (replenishment of pathway intermediates) role to replenish NAG that is lost due to degradation or cell division |CITS: [12633501]|.
/
/In some bacteria, such as <i>Bacillus</i> sp. |CITS: [8473852 ]|, <i>Nisseria gonorrhoeae</i> |CITS: [1339419]|, |FRAME:TAX-2337| |CITS: [10931207]| and in yeast (|FRAME:TAX-4932|) |CITS: [9428669]|, OAT can have a dual enzymic function. In these organisms, either <i>N</i>-acetylornithine or acetyl-CoA can be used as acetyl donors for formation of NAG.  <i>argJ</i> genes from such organisms can complement both <i>argE</i> and <i>argA</i> mutations in |FRAME:TAX-562|. However, these organisms still possess separate NAGS enzymes encoded by <i>argA</i> genes. The biological role of duplicate NAGS activity in these organisms remains to be elucidated |CITS: [12633501]|.
/
/<b>Additional yeast-specific info from the |FRAME:TAX-4930| Genome Database:</b>
/
/The first five steps of arginine biosynthesis in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> take place in the mitochondrion
/|CITS: [11553611][Hinnebusch]|. This part of the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the
/acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate
/generated in the fifth step.
/The enzymes that catalyze the second and third steps are encoded by a single gene (ARG5,6) that is translated
/into a pre-protein which is imported into mitochondria and cleaved there to yield two enzymes, <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate
/kinase and <i>N</i>-acetylglutamyl-phosphate reductase |CITS: [1649049]|.
/These enzymes form a complex with each other and with <i>N</i>-acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme in the
/pathway, which may have implications for regulation of their activity |CITS: [11553611]|.
/The mitochondrial steps of the arginine biosynthesis pathway result in the formation of ornithine, which is exported
/to the cytoplasm by the transporter Ort1p |CITS: [8798783]|. In the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to
/L-arginine in three reactions mediated by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, arginosuccinate synthase, and
/argininosuccinate lyase.  Transcription of genes of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, as well as of other amino
/acid biosynthetic pathways, is activated by the transcription factor Gcn4p under conditions of amino acid
/starvation |CITS: [11390663][Hinnebusch]|. Transcription of ARG1, ARG3, ARG5,6, and ARG8 is also
/repressed in the presence of arginine by the ArgR/Mcm1p complex, which consists of Arg80p, Arg81p, Arg82p,
/and Mcm1p |CITS: [14563547]|. The transcriptional activator Gcn4p interacts with subunits of the ArgR/Mcm1p
/repressor, allowing for fine-tuning of transcriptional control in response to arginine availability |CITS: [15289616]|.

CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: Phosphoinositides "Phosphoinositides"| play a key role in signal transduction in the eukaryotic cell, transmitting signals from the cell surface to modulate intracellular processes. One well known phosphoinositide pathway produces the secondary messengers |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| and |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL "diacylglycerol"| and is described in |FRAME: PWY-6351|.
/
/The 3-phosphoinositide pathway described here is another one of the major pathways of intracellular signal transduction. At the center of this pathway are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases), enzymes that produce the monophosphate |FRAME: CPD-177 "phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate"|, the bisphosphate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-34-BISPH "phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate"| and the trisphosphate |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-345-TRIPHOSPHATE "phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate"|, all important compounds in 
/signaling cascades that influences a wide variety of cellular functions.
/
/The 3-phosphoinositide pathway has been implicated in growth factor-dependent mitogenesis, membrane ruffling and glucose uptake, cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation, cell survival, cell migration, and intracellular protein trafficking. |CITS: [8086005]|. Some of the products of the PI 3-kinases, namely  |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-34-BISPH "phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate"| and the trisphosphate |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-345-TRIPHOSPHATE "phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate"|, are almost absent in quiescent cells but are produced rapidly upon stimulation by a variety of factors, suggesting a likely function as second messengers. In addition, these compounds do not seem to be substrates for phospholipases C |CITS: [2553693]|, and it has been proposed that they may act via the activation of certain protein kinases such as Akt/RAC/PKB and certain protein kinase C isoforms |CITS: [ 8181054][7798235]|.
/
/
/The enzymes responsible for the generation of 3' phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, have been assigned to three classes based on structural similarity, substrate specificity, and probable mechanism of activation |CITS: [9247130]|. 
/
/Class I is composed of heterodimeric enzymes, each containing one catalytic subunit, encoded by |FRAME: HS04527|, |FRAME: HS00644|, |FRAME: HS02818| or |FRAME: HS10353|, and one regulatory subunit, encoded by |FRAME: HS07270|, |FRAME: HS02779|, |FRAME: HS04135|, |FRAME: HS13887| or |FRAME: HS16294|. Even though all class I enzymes can phosphorylate <i>in vitro</i> |FRAME:L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols "phosphatidylinositol"|, |FRAME: CPD-1108| and |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, only the later is beleived to be the <i>in vivo</i> substrate (|FRAME:2.7.1.153-RXN "EC 2.7.1.153"|).
/
/Class II enzymes are monomeric proteins that are distinguished by a carboxy-terminal C2 (CalB) |FRAME: CA+2|-binding domain |CITS: [9632630]|, and are encoded by |FRAME: HS00315|, |FRAME: HS05725| and |FRAME: HS06583|. They accept several types of substrates, and are the only mammalian enzyme thought to catalyze |FRAME:2.7.1.154-RXN "EC 2.7.1.154"|. 
/
/Class III enzymes are heterodimeric, composed of a catalytic subunit (|FRAME: HS01275|) and a regulatory subunit (|FRAME: HS03788|). These enzymes, which are homologs of the yeast Vps34p protein, can only phosphorylate |FRAME:L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols| (|FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-3-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.137"|).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  During senescence chlorophyll is degraded by chlorophyllase.  This results in the release of 
/large amounts of chlorophyllide and phytol.  Although the degradation pathway of chlorophyllide (see |FRAME:PWY-5098|) 
/has been the subject of a number of studies, the fate of phytol is not so clear.  It has been shown that chlorophyll 
/degradation is linked to |FRAME:PWY-1422| during senescence, prompting the hypothesis that phytol released from 
/chlorophyll might be channeled into tocopherol synthesis via a salvage pathway |CITS:[Rise89],[Peisker89]|.  This view was 
/further supported by the phenotype of the Arabidopsis phytol kinase mutant vte5-1. Blocking the first step of phytol salvage, 
/the mutant seed tocopherol levels were reduced to 20% of the wild type|CITS: [16361393]|.  Feeding experiments of <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings with radioactive phytol have indeed shown that, besides chlorophyll, free 
/phytol is incorporated into tocopherol and a variety of undefined lipid esters |CITS:[16306049]|.  Moreover, although it is 
/unlikely that large amounts of phytol released from chlorophyll degradation be incorporated into phylloquinone, this 
/compound was nevertheless identified as a product of phytol recycling along with the other lipid esters |CITS:[16306049]|.
/
/<b>Enzymatic steps:</b>  Although both enzyme activities required for this pathway (phytol kinase and phytyl-P kinase 
/activities) have been detected in plants, only the enzymes catalyzing the phytol kinase reaction has been isolated: a 
/mutant involved in tocopherol biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<i>vte5-1</i>) has been shown to be affected in phytyl-P 
/formation.  The gene affected by the mutation was subsequently shown to encode a protein with phytol kinase activity when 
/heterologously expressed in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [16361393]|.

COMMENT - IAA (indole-3-acetic acid), one of the most common active forms of the phytohormone auxin, is often
/present in conjugated forms. Free IAA is involved in regulating many aspects of plant growth from
/embryogenesis to root and shoot development and reproduction.
/Meanwhile, conjugated forms of auxin play varied roles: some still have biological activity, others serve as inactive
/storage forms, and some appear to be permanently inactivated |CITS:[15749753]|.
/
/A number of different IAA metabolites have been isolated in Arabidopsis, including
/|FRAME:INDOLE-3-ACETYL-ALA indole-3-acetyl-alanine|, |FRAME:INDOLE-3-ACETYL-LEU indole-3-acetyl-leucine|,
/|FRAME:INDOLE-3-ACETYL-ASP indole-3-acetyl-aspartate|, |FRAME:INDOLE-3-ACETYL-GLU indole-3-acetyl-glutamate|,
/|FRAME:2-OXINDOLE-3-ACETYL-ASP 2-oxindole-3-acetyl-asp|, and |FRAME:CPD-1102 indole-3-acetyl-&beta;-1-D-glucose| (rev in |CITS:[15749753]|).
/But, new conjugated forms of IAA continue to be identified through improved isolation and verification
/technologies, including 6-hydroxy-IAA-valine (6-OH-IAA-Val) and 6-hydroxy-IAA-phenylalanine
/(6-OH-IAA-Phe). These were identified using LC-ESI-MS/MS techniques and compared to
/synthetically prepared standards that were confirmed using NMR spectroscopy and mass
/spectrometry |CITS:[17548096]|. Radiotracer labeling studies indicate that 6-OH-IAA-Val
/and 6-OH-IAA-Phe can be generated using deuterated forms of IAA-Val and IAA-Phe respectively,
/whereas they do not seem to arise from a 6-hydroxy-IAA precursor |CITS:[17548096]|.
/Neither IAA-Val nor IAA-Phe have been isolated from Arabidopsis to date, though there is some
/evidence for the presence of these compounds in mosses and liverworts |CITS:[ 10562246]|.
/Moreover some GH3 family members from Arabidopsis can synthesis IAA-Val and/or IAA-Phe
/in vitro |CITS:[ 15659623]|, and a recombinant IAA-amide hydrolase from Arabidopsis, ILR1,
/can act on IAA-Phe and IAA-Val |CITS:[7792599]|. Additional conjugates of these compounds,
/namely |FRAME: CPD-9596 oxindole-3-acetyl-valine| and |FRAME:CPD-9595 oxindole-3-acetyl-phenylalanine|, were also
/generated during the radiotracing studies.  These IAA metabolites have not been
/encountered in Arabidopsis plants yet, either, but will be investigated in the future. 
/
/Neither 6-OH-IAA-Val nor 6-OH-IAA-phenylalanine show auxin activity in root
/elongation assays in Arabidopsis seedlings, suggesting that they are inactive
/products of auxin catabolism |CITS:[17548096]|. Subsequent modifications to these
/molecules are likely |CITS:[17548096]| and need to be characterized to yield a full understanding
/of auxin metabolism in Arabidopsis.

COMMENT - The plant pathway spans cytosol and mitochondria. It is composed of the cytosolic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, 
/the mitochondrial enzymes GABA-transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. An alternative route of 
/converting succinic semialdehyde is via the cytosolic enzyme gamma-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. The role of the 
/alternative product 4-hydroxybutyrate in plants is unclear. While mammals only have 2-oxoglutarate-dependent 
/GABA-transaminase, both 2-oxoglutarate-dependent and pyruvate-dependent GABA-transaminase activities have 
/been detected in crude plant extracts. The physiological roles and significance of this pathway include: 1) Assimilates 
/carbons from glutamate to succinate which then enters the TCA cycle and thus functions as part of the mechanism 
/plants use to maintain the carbon-nitrogen balance; 2) Protects plants from oxidative stress by providing the 
/mitochondrial respiratory chain with NADH and succinate, generated in the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase 
/reaction; 3) Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is activated by acidic pH, and that the reaction catalyzed by GAD 
/removes protons suggesting the pathway may also regulate the cytosolic pH balance; 4) The intermediate metabolite 
/gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) is speculated to function as a nitrogen storage form, a deterrent of plant pathogen, 
/an osmo-regulator, and a plant signal molecule involved in pollen tube growth. For a comprehensive review 
/see|CITS: [15003233]|.

/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  
/
/The epoxidation reaction of the xanthophyll cycle consists of the conversion of zeaxanthin to

TYPES - PhosphatidylcholineBiosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis I
CITATIONS - li10
CITATIONS - 15147879:EV-EXP:3483395369:dreher
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Phosphatidylcholine is one of the major constituents of membrane phospholipids in eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN2-PWY|).  It is also present in the membranes of some bacteria. The phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathways vary among different organisms. 
/
/At least four alternative routes have been reported in plants (see 1-4 below, |CITS: [16666397][16666464][11115895][7998981][15147879]|). Additional routes were reported in animals and yeast (see 1 and 5 below, |CITS: [438165][16246068]| and reviewed in |CITS: [18204095][17010666]|) and bacteria (see 1, 5 and 6 below, |CITS: [10858449][14756787]| and reviewed in |CITS: [14663079][20656373]|).
/
/1) The first pathway (depicted here) is a branch of the Kennedy pathway for the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (|FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-ETHANOLAMINE|) and phosphatidylcholine (|FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE|) in eukaryotes (reviewed in |CITS: [20503434]|) (see also |FRAME: PWY4FS-6|). 
/
/2) The second pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-2|) depends on three consecutive <i>N</i>-methylation steps that are carried out on phospho-bases, phosphoethanolamine, phospho-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine, and phospho-<i>N</i>-dimethylethanolamine. 
/
/3) The third pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-3|) depends on an initial <i>N</i>-methylation with phospho-base phosphoethanolamine, and followed by two downstream <i>N</i>-methylations on phosphatidyl-bases, phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-dimethylethanolamine. In plants, phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine is believed to be derived from CDP-methylethanolamine, whereas in animals, it is a direct methylation product from phosphatidylethanolamine |CITS: [438165]|. 
/
/4) The fourth pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-4|) depends on two <i>N</i>-methylations with phospho-base phosphoethanolamine and phospho-<i>N</i>-methylethanolamine, followed by a downstream <i>N</i>-methylation on phosphatidyl-base phosphatidyl-<i>N</i>-dimethylethanolamine.
/
/5) The fifth pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6825|) depends on the direct conversion of the phosphatidyl-base phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine by successive methylations.
/
/6) The sixth pathway (|FRAME: PWY-6826|) involves a one-step direct condensation of |FRAME: CHOLINE| with CDP-diacylglycerol to form phosphatidylcholine by the bacterial enzyme phosphatidylcholine synthase (EC 2.7.8.24).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway depends on choline kinase and on the availability of |FRAME: CHOLINE|.  Animals obtain |FRAME: CHOLINE|, an essential nutrient, primarily from the diet.  They can also produce |FRAME: CHOLINE| by conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine (see 5 above) followed by catabolism of phosphatidylcholine to |FRAME: CHOLINE| (see pathway |FRAME: LIPASYN-PWY|) (reviewed in |CITS: [18204095]|).
/
/The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| also utilizes the pathway shown here, although the methylation pathway shown in |FRAME: PWY-6825| is its primary pathway.  In the pathway shown here, either exogenous |FRAME: CHOLINE| is taken up by active transport, or endogenous |FRAME: CHOLINE| can be obtained from phosphatidylcholine turnover (reviewed in  |CITS: [17010666][16246068]|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Elemental-selenium Selenium| is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans but has not yet been proven to be an essential micronutrient for land plants |CITS: [11683552][16307305]|. There is evidence, however, of Chlamydomonas proteins that contains a |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE selenocysteine| residue suggesting that algal species might also require |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| |CITS: [17105189][12110581]|. The health requirement of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| for humans and animals can be met by crops and forage plants that contain selenocompounds. |FRAME: TAX-4232 <i>Helianthus annuus</i>| among the oilseed crops was shown to be a good source for this micronutrient |CITS: [15012198]|. In addition, there is evidence that certain seleno-compounds, including |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE selenomethionine|, have anti-carcinogenic properties |CITS: [14748935]|.   
/
/Despite its importance as a micronutrient, higher concentrations of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| are toxic to humans, other animals, and plants largely because transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur and sulfo-compound metabolism can often erroneously substitute |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| for sulfur and can misincorporate seleno-amino acids into proteins |CITS: [21913064][12753978][16661781]|. 
/
/In general, plants take up both |FRAME: SELENATE selenate| and |FRAME: SELENITE selenite| from soil. A series of |FRAME: PWY-6932 reduction steps| converts |FRAME: SELENATE selenate| to |FRAME: SE-2 selenide| / |FRAME: CPD-678 hydrogen selenide| and this is assimilated into the seleno-amino acids |FRAME: L-SELENOCYSTEINE selenocysteine| and |FRAME: SELENOMETHIONINE selenomethionine| |CITS: [19309459]|.
/
/In Se accumulator plants, these seleno-amino acids may be modified to create organic seleno-compounds for storage. Seasonal weeds like |FRAME: TAX-3575 <i>Silene gallica</i>| and |FRAME: TAX-83445 <i>Avena sterilis</i> ludoviciana| along with perennial weeds like |FRAME: TAX-41550 <i>Cirsium arvense</i>| employ this strategy and accumulate high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>| |CITS: [19800657]|. Se accumulation can help to protect plants against attacks by prairie dogs, insects, and fungi (see refs in |CITS: [21628258]|).
/
/Other plants, like |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| generate seleno-compounds as well, but rather than storing them, they transform them into less toxic volatile compounds
/such as |FRAME: CPD-12005 dimethyl selenide| (DMSe) that can then be released from the plants |CITS: [10759525]|. This process is also called phytovolatilization |CITS: [19656903]|.  
/
/While these strategies directly benefit the plants that employ them, they can also be put to use for the phytoremediation  of seleniferous soils that contain dangerously high amounts of |FRAME: Elemental-selenium Se<sup>0</sup>|. Numerous insights into endogenous seleno-compound metabolism in plants have been gained through efforts to engineer plants that show improved selenium phytoremediation abilities |CITS: [15005814][19800657][19893365][17445958][10759525]|.

/<b>About this pathway</b>
/
/Selenocysteine formation likely parallels the cysteine biosynthetic pathway in plants, and may use many of the same enzymes.The first step in cysteine biosynthesis involes a serine acetyltransferase (SAT). While there is definite evidence of enzymes capable of producing O-acetyl-L-serine in Arabidopsis and many other plant species, these enzymes have not yet been explicitly linked to selenium metabolism <i>in planta</i>. In fact, when SAT activity is compared across different <i>Astragalus</i> species that accumulate vastly different levels of selenium, no correlation is detected |CITS: [    15941393]|. Selenocysteine formation is likely to be catalyzed by O-acetyl-L-serine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) enzymes and selenocysteine production in the presence of O-acteyl-serine has been measured in a number of plants including including <i>Pisum sativum</i> (pea), clover, and several <i>Astralagus</i> species |CITS: [NG78]|. This activity could be competitively inhibited by sulfur, and conversely, cysteine biosynthesis could be competetively inhibited by selenium, arguing that these reactions are catalyzed by the same enzymes |CITS: [NG78]|. Direct evidence for OAS-TL-based production of selenocysteine has only been demonstrated in the bacteria <i>Paracoccus denitrificans</i> to date |CITS: [14692]|, but it is likely that plant OAS-TLs catalyze this reaction, too.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-13717 L-selenocystathionine| production probably depends on the activity of the cystathionine synthase enzymes that play a comparable role in sulfate metabolism. Over-expression of an Arabidopsis |FRAME: AT3G01120 CGS1|  enzyme in <i>Brassica juncea</i> appears to increase flux through this pathway and leads to higher levels of volatile selenium compound production |CITS: [14618405]|.
/
/Evidence for activity of the next enzyme in the pathway, &beta;-(seleno)cystathionine lyase can be detected in plant extracts from several species including selenium non-accumulators, such as spinach (see |FRAME: MONOMER-16912 L-cystathione &beta;-lyase / &beta; L-selenocystathionase| ), pea and Se accumulators, such as <i>Astragalus bisulcatus</i>. As seen for many other enzymes in this pathway, it is active with both the sulfur and selenium analogs |CITS: [MCCLUSKEY86]|.
/
/The final step toward selenomethionine biosynthesis could be catalyzed by at least three different types of enzymes if the proteins involved in |FRAME: PWY-702 methionine biosynthesis II| also participate in selenomethionine (Se-Met) metabolism. For instance, <i>E.coli</i> has both cobalamin-dependent (2.1.1.13) and cobalamin-independent enzymes (|FRAME: RXN-12730 2.1.1.14|) that can catalyze the formation of Se-Met |CITS: [11078203]|. No cobalamin-independent candidates have been found in Arabidopsis. On the other hand, it does have three cobalamin-independent methionine synthases (see |FRAME: RXN-12730 2.1.14|) which could also potentially accept selenohomocysteine, but their role in seleno-amino acid biosynthesis has not yet been tested |CITS: [15024005]|.  
/
/These seleno-amino acids can be misincorporated during protein synthesis. To prevent this, selenium accumulating or hyperaccumulating plants typically transform them into non-coding seleno-amino acids, such as Se-methylselenocysteine or other related compounds. Non-accumulating plants employ a different strategy and further metabolize these seleno-amino acids into the production of volatile compounds that can be released into the atmosphere |CITS: [16307305]|.

/The first purine nucleotide that is synthesized <i>de novo</i> is |FRAME: IMP|. IMP is converted to |FRAME: XANTHOSINE-5-PHOSPHATE| by the enzyme |FRAME: IMP-DEHYDROG-CPLX|, and the latter is converted to the first guanosine nucleotide, |FRAME: GMP|, by the action of |FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX|, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate.
/
/GMP is phosphorylated to |FRAME: GDP| and subsequently to |FRAME: GTP| by the enzymes
/|FRAME: GUANYL-KIN-CPLX| and |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX|, respectively.

COMMON-NAME - lipid-dependent phytate biosynthesis II (via Ins(1,3,4)P<sub>3</sub>)
CITATIONS - 16107538:EV-EXP:3338298725:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant <i>myo</i>-inositol phosphate (hexa<i>kis</i>phosphate) in plant cells.  Phytate serves as a storage form of  <i>myo</i>-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth.  It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) known as phytin |CITS:[11590064],[8744268]|.  Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin |CITS:[15700415]|.  Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see |CITS:[14568069]|).  The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties.  Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract.  Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption.  Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution |CITS:[11590064],[11906835]|.  Currently, little is known of the biosynthesis of phytate.  There appears to be several routes of synthesis: a lipid-dependent route which uses Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> produced from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis by phospholipase C (see |FRAME:LIPASYN-PWY|), and a lipid-independent route relying on the phosphorylation of <i>myo</i>-inositol or Ins(3)P.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>  In this pathway, phytate is also obtained from the successive phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> released from PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate) by the action of a specific phospholipase C, as is the case in |FRAME:PWY-4541|.  The utilization of lipid-derived Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, however, is indirect in that it first requires the conversion of Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to Ins(1,3,4)P<sub>3</sub>.  This presumably occurs through the action of a 3-kinase which produces Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub>, which is then hydrolyzed by a 5-phosphatase to produce Ins(1,3,4)P<sub>3</sub> |CITS:[14568069]|.  Ins(1,3,4)P<sub>3</sub> is then converted by a type of Ins trisphosphate kinases which do not recognize Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> as substrate: an Ins(1,3,4)P<sub>3</sub> 5-/6-kinase.  The following phosphorylation steps are catalyzed by the same enzymes used in |FRAME:PWY-4541|: an Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> 3-/5-/6-kinase, which in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is encoded by two genes, <i>AtIPK2&alpha;</i> and<i>AtIPK2&beta;</i>; and an inositol polyphosphate 2-kinase, encoded by  the <i>Arabidopsis AtIPK1</i> gene.  All of these proteins can catalyze the conversion of several inositol phosphates.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL "Methylglyoxal"| is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|), fatty acid metabolism (via |FRAME:ACETONE|), and protein metabolism (via |FRAME:AMINO-ACETONE|). |FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL "Methylglyoxal"| is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see |CITS: [10597025]| for a review).
/There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds. These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/There are several pathways for the removal of methylglyoxal. In this pathway, methylglyoxal is reduced to acetol by the action of various enymes possessing |FRAME: G7558-MONOMER| activity. 
/Most of the enzymes that have been characterized with this activity belong to the family of NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductases (AKRs). For example, the human aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) and aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2) are both capable of reducing methylglyoxal to acetol |CITS: [1537826]|. Other mammalian AKRs that were shown to catalyze this reaction include AKR1, AKR1A, AKR1B1, AKR7, AKR7A2 and AKR7A5 |CITS: [16919][10510318][12123834][12604212]|.
/
/Several |FRAME: TAX-83333| enzymes homologous to the mammalian AKRs have also been shown to catalyze the same reaction |CITS: [9095467]|. Overexpression of the aldo-keto reductase AKR14A1, encoded by the |FRAME:G7558| gene, leads to increased resistance to methylglyoxal |CITS: [12583903]|. In addition, three other genes (|FRAME:G6967|, |FRAME:G7565|, and |FRAME:EG11648|) were shown to encode proteins with similar activities |CITS:[16077126]|.
/All four proteins were purified, and shown to catalyze the reaction in vitro, in the presence of NADPH. A similar enzyme has been identified in cyanobacteria |CITS: [16804176]|.
/
/A variation has been found in the Saccharomycete fungus |FRAME: TAX-1004253|, in which an NADH-dependent methylglyoxal reductase has been documented |CITS: [Inoue92]|.
/
/Prolonged incubations of |FRAME:TAX-562| cell-free extracts with methylglyoxal resulted in conversion of acetol to |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| |CITS: [16077126]|. The enzyme proposed to catalyze this reaction is |FRAME:GLYCDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [6183251][3920199]|. A similar conversion has been observed in other microorganisms, such as |FRAME: TAX-1517|
/|CITS: [Cameron86]|. In bacteria |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| is a dead-end metabolite and exits the cell rapidly |CITS: [2644239]|.
/
/The same reaction has also been observed in mammalian systems, where it is catalyzed by |FRAME: HS01502-MONOMER| |CITS: [1537826]|. In mammals |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| is metabolized in the liver to L-lactate |CITS: [1537826]|.

TYPES - Fatty-Acid-Degradation
COMMON-NAME - fatty acid beta-oxidation V (unsaturated, odd number, di-isomerase-dependent)
CITATIONS - 16040662:EV-EXP:3520184791:peifenz
COMMENT - This is an alternative degradation route of fatty acids with cis-double bonds on odd-number carbons, for example, oleate, that was proposed after the identification of a delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase from yeast |CITS: [10455114]|. The physiological role of the yeast DCI1 however remains unclear since yeast mutants with a deletion in DCI1 showed no deficiency in utilization of oleate |CITS: [10455114]|. Later, this pathway was thought to be present in Arabidopsis based on the identification of the Arabidopsis DCI1 |CITS: [16040662], [17434787]|. No genetics data are available for the Arabidopsis DCI1 thus its physiological role in fatty acid degradation is still unclear.
/
/In this pathway, unsaturated fatty acids with cis-double bonds on odd-number carbons (i.e. a double bond on the 9th position in the case of oleate) are converted to cis-5-enoyl-CoA after two rounds of |FRAME: PWY-5136 "core beta oxidation cycle"|. Instead of continuing for another round of core beta-oxidation cycle which would yield cis-3-enoyl-CoA to enter |FRAME: PWY-5137 fatty acid &beta;-oxidation III (unsaturated, odd number)|, cis-5-enoyl-CoA once being oxidized to trans-2,cis-5-dienoyl-CoA exits the core beta oxidation. It is converted to trans-3,cis-5-dienoyl-CoA by delta3,delta2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. Trans-3,cis-5-dienoyl-CoA is then converted by the di-isomerase delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase to trans-2,trans-4-dienoyl-CoA. The latter is further converted to trans-3-enoyl-CoA by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. Finally, trans-3-enoyl-CoA is converted to trans-2-enoyl-CoA to reenter core beta oxidation for complete degradation.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/While the amino acid |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| is not involved
/directly in protein synthesis, it is an important intermediate in many metabolic pathways, such as
/the |FRAME:PWY-4984| and the biosynthesis of several compounds, including arginine
/(see |FRAME:ARGSYN-PWY| and |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), proline (see |FRAME:PWY-3341|
/and |FRAME:PWY-4981|), and putrescine (|FRAME:PWY-46|), which leads to the biosynthesis of other
/polyamines and pyrimidines.  It is also involved in |FRAME: PWY-6818|.
/
/This pathway documents the synthesis of |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| from |FRAME:GLT| via
/<i>N</i>-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the
/spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to proline biosynthesis (see
/|FRAME:PROSYN-PWY|), thus keeping the pathways leading to arginine and proline separate
/(|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein). 
/
/Two alternative pathways have evolved, which differ in the way the key intermediate
/|FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG) is formed, and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another
/intermediate, |FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE|.
/In this pathway, which is less common, NAG is formed by NAG synthase, and
/|FRAME:N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase,
/forming |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| and |FRAME: ACET|.
/In the other pathway (see |FRAME:ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|), which is found in most of the prokaryotic and
/eukaryotic microbes investigated up to now, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is
/removed from |FRAME: N-ALPHA-ACETYLORNITHINE| is recycled onto |FRAME: GLT|, regenerating
/|FRAME: ACETYL-GLU| (NAG). 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This ornithine biosynthesis pathway has been found in the |FRAME:TAX-543|
/|FRAME: TAX-83333| and |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [3534538]|,
/the |FRAME: TAX-641| |CITS: [10692366]|, the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-34|
/|CITS: [ 9829957]|, and the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2287| |CITS: [vandecasteele90]|.

/|FRAME:N-ACETYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10063| gene.

TYPES - Jasmonates-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - jasmonoyl-amino acid conjugates biosynthesis II
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Jasmonates an important class of compounds related to |FRAME:Jasmonic-Acids "jasmonic acid"|, are found throughout
/the plant kingdom as well as in fungi |CITS:[17513307]|.
/These compounds may participate in a number of biological processes including resistance to herbivores and some
/pathogens, protection against ozone, senescence, and reproductive development (reviewed in |CITS:[19025383][17513307]|). 
/
/Many different jasmonate precursors and jasmonate derivatives have biological activity, including jasmonyl
/(JA)-amino acid conjugates. Different species may have a different array of JA-amino acid conjugates, and the
/biological activity of each compound may differ between species. For example, jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has
/been shown to have biological activity in a number of different plants, including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
/|CITS:[15258265][18247047]|, |FRAME:TAX-49451||CITS:[17273867][17085687]|, <i>Achyranthes bidentata</i>
/|CITS:[18812165]|, barley |CITS:[9315685]|, tomato |CITS:[18458331]|, rice |CITS:[ 9013895]| and others.
/In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, JA-Ile promotes the interaction between COI1 (an F-box) protein and the
/JAZ1 repressor protein. In this manner, JA-Ile is believed
/to help destabilize the JAZ1 repressor and thereby promote JA-responsive transcription |CITS:[17637677]|.
/COI1 and JAZ homologs have been found in other plants, such as tomato, where they also bind in a JA-Ile-dependent
/manner, |CITS:[18458331]|, indicating that JA-Ile might have a similar function in other plant species. Additional studies
/in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that the specific isomeric forms of the same jasmonate can
/have very different biological effects |CITS: [19349968]|. 
/
/Interestingly, in  <i>Polygonum longisetum</i>, a weed commonly found in Japan, a treatment of 100 uM JA-Ile fails
/to stimulate the normal JA-responsive emissions of volatile sesquiterpenes |CITS:[TAMOGAMI07]| indicating that even
/JA-Ile may not be similarly effective in all plants. Other differences in biological activity have been observed across species for many other
/conjugates including
/JA-ACC, JA-leucine, and JA-valine. 
/
/In <i>N.attenuata</i>, jasmonate signaling is an important part of the response to herbivory |CITS:[17513307]|.
/The level of JA as well as JA-Ile, JA-Leu, JA-Val, and JA-Gln all rise in response to wounding and treatment
/with oral secretions from the herbivorous tobacco hornworm |FRAME:TAX-7130|. On the other hand, JA-Trp,
/JA-Met, and JA-ACC have not been detected in this species |CITS:[17513307]|. JA-Ile is involved
/in herbivore resistance |CITS:[17085687]|, but JA-Val and JA-Leu do not appear to stimulate herbivore defense responses |CITS:[18065562]|. It is unclear whether these are storage forms of JA or catabolic intermediates. Another important
/phytohormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), can be conjugated with several amino acids, as shown in the
/|FRAME:PWY-6219| pathway for Arabidopsis thaliana. Some of these compounds, such as IAA-aspartate are targeted for further
/breakdown (|CITS:[9733548]|, (see |FRAME:PWY-2021|), while others, such as, IAA-alanine may serve
/as storage forms. A family of amido hydrolases can release free, active IAA from some of these
/"storage" IAA conjugates |CITS:[7792259][10072397]|. But, to date, no JA-amido hydrolases (that can release free
/JA from the amino acid conjugates) have been identified in plants. However, this enzymatic activity has been
/detected in the fungus, <i>Botryodiplodia theobromae</i> |CITS:[9141491]|.
/Further work will be required to determine the metabolic and functional fate of the "inactive" JA-amino acid
/conjugates identified in <i>N. attenuata</i>.
/
/
/Reduced levels of JAR4 and JAR6 transcripts lead to lower levels of JA-Ile, JA-Leu, and JA-Val,
/suggesting that the <i>in vivo</i> synthesis of these compounds requires these enzymes. JA-Gln levels are not
/affected in these mutants, indicating that at least one other enzyme capable of generating jasmonyl-amino acid
/conjugates exists in this species |CITS:[17273867][17085687]|.

COMMENT - All three branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, are essential amino acids, which human and animals must obtain from their diet. The biosynthesis pathways in plants are largely inferred from microbial pathways. Valine and leucine are both derived from pyruvate. Their biosynthesis shares the same initial steps. On the other hand, isoleucine is derived from threonine. However, the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway is almost parallel to valine biosynthesis, except for its first step which involves a threonine deaminase. These two pathways share four common enzymes, each enzyme has dual substrate specificity.
/
/Many steps in the branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis pathways are commercially significant targets for herbicides. They include threonine deaminase, acetolactate synthase, and ketol-acid reductoisomerase. 
/
/This pathway occurs in plastids.

COMMON-NAME - scopoletin biosynthesis
CITATIONS - 18547395:EV-EXP:3512405403:peifenz
COMMENT - Scopoletin (7-hydroxy-6-methoxy coumarin) is a hydroxycoumarin. It is found in a number of plant species including Arabidopsis, cassava, sweet potato, sunflower, cotton and tobacco |CITS: [19004461], [18547395]|. Scopoletin is thought to be involved in plant defense responses. In tobacco, accumulation of scopoletin was shown to strongly correlate with tobacco mosaic virus-induced localized acquired resistance |CITS: [12060240]|. Scopoletin was indicated to have many pharmacological effects as well, such as antidepressant |CITS: [20599906]|, anti-arthritic |CITS: [21078410]|, anti-gastro-esophageal inflammatory |CITS: [21163341]|, potential in ameliorate insulin resistance |CITS: [20886413]|, and potential in treatment of hypertriglyceridemia |CITS: [17786283]|. In addition, it was also shown to have antitermite activity |CITS: [20563628]|.
/
/The biosynthesis pathway leading to scopoletin in plants is still largely unclear. Genetic and biochemical evidence in Arabidopsis supports that, in this plant, scopoletin is derived from feruloyl-CoA, not ferulate |CITS: [18547395]| as previously thought. A 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase is responsible for the ortho-hydroxylation of feruloyl-CoA, an important branch point from lignin biosynthesis. Ortho-hydroxylation of the feruloyl-CoA aromatic ring is followed by trans-cis isomerization of the side chain, and subsequent lactonization to close the ring and yield scopoletin. The mechanism of the E-Z isomerization step in the biosynthesis of coumarins varies between genera or even species, for being either light-dependent photoisomerization or light-independent enzyme catalyzed isomerization |CITS: [19004461]|. It is not clear what mechanism is involved in the above depicted scopoletin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis.

COMMENT - In plants, glycine can be generated from at least three routes. One involves serine 
/hydroxymethyltransferase. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyzes a reversible reaction, the 
/interconversion of serine and glycine. The reaction equilibrium slightly favors glycine production. In 
/leaves, during photorespiration when the high concentration of glycine is produced, the reaction is 
/driven towards serine biosynthesis. In roots and other non-photorespiratory tissues, the enzyme more 
/likely contributes to glycine biosynthesis. The Arabidopsis genome has at least five predicted serine 
/hydroxymethyltransferase genes. Two of them have mitochondrial targeting signals, and the other three 
/don't have any organelle targeting signals and probably cytosolic|CITS: [10806255]|. However, their 
/molecular functions and in vivo roles remain to be characterized.
/
/Another route of glycine biosynthesis is via threonine aldolase, which converts threonine to glycine and 
/acetaldehyde. There are two genes in Arabidopsis encoding functional threonine aldolase. Knock-out 
/mutants of THA1 have a 50-fold buildup of threonine and a 50% decrease of glycine content in seedlings. 
/Knock-out mutants of THA2 is lethal. The THA2 mutant can be rescued by overproduction of threonine 
/deaminase, another route of threonine degradation, indicating that over-accumulation of threonine rather 
/than the decrease of glycine causes the lethal phenotype. It also indicates that glycine production via 
/the threonine aldolase route is not essential in Arabidopsis|CITS: [17172352]|.    
/
/Glycine can also be produced from glyoxylate by glyoxylate aminotransferase. There are at least two 
/distinct types of glyoxylate aminotransferase activities in plants. One has primarily serine:glyoxylate 
/aminotransferase activity, the other exhibits primarily glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In 
/Arabidopsis, a single gene, AGT1, encodes the former enzyme, whereas two genes AOAT1 (GGAT1) 
/and AOAT2 (GGAT2) are responsible for the later enzyme activity. Mutations of AGT1 or AOAT1 indicate 
/that both genes are important for photorespiration in the peroxisome|CITS: [11309139][12631323]|.

TYPES - SUCROSE-DEG
COMMON-NAME - sucrose degradation II (sucrose synthase)
CITATIONS - Dey97:EV-AS:3579462741:dreher
COMMENT - Oxygen deprivation is a primary stress in plants subjected to flooding. Under low oxygen tensions, plants modify several aspects of their metabolism, in particular by shifting from respiratory to fermentative energy production |CITS:[RICARD94],[VARTAPETIAN97]|. Increased activity of the ethanol fermentation pathway from pyruvate allows reoxidation of NADH produced in glycolysis, thus enabling the plant to generate ATP independent of oxidative phosphorylation |CITS:[11787018]|. Anaerobic treatment of maize seedling was shown to drastically alter the profile of total protein synthesis. In an anaerobic environment 20 proteins, which account for more than 70% of the total translation, are selectively synthesized |CITS:[7418006]|. Most of the anaerobic proteins identified were found to be enzymes of glycolysis or sugar-phosphate metabolism: sucrose synthase, aldolase, pyruvate decarboxylase, enolase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase |CITS:[12509333]|. Under anaerobic conditions, sucrose is mobilized from several other pathways to enter glycolysis via its conversion to glucose and fructose. Whereas in an aerobic environment the end-product of glycolysis: pyruvate, is metabolized into acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is metabolized to form either lactate or ethanol. Evidence suggests that the reduction of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase is a minor pathway. Indeed, the lowering of pH concomitant to lactate accumulation is likely to switch off lactate production whilst activating pyruvate decarboxylase involved in the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, in turn metabolized to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase |CITS:[DEY97]|.

COMMENT - Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is an abundant form of the potent phytohormone auxin. It affects many aspects of plant growth and development and also participates in responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli |CITS: [15749753] [18541211]|. IAA can be conjugated to a number of small molecules, including sugars and amino acids and it can be modified with additional functional groups, including a methyl group. All of these additions, including methylation, can affect the biological activity and biochemical properties of this important hormone |CITS: [15749753]|. 
/
/The biological relevance of methyl IAA (MeIAA) is still under investigation. The addition of a methyl group to IAA converts it from an acid to a nonpolar compound and should enable it to cross membranes more easily. |CITS:[18467465]|. Some experiments suggest that MeIAA is an inactive form of IAA |CITS:[18467465]|. On the other hand, several studies have shown that the exogenous application of MeIAA can cause auxin-like phenotypic changes in plants, and, in some cases, the phenotypes are even stronger than when IAA is applied directly |CITS:[16169896][17926040]|. Therefore, if MeIAA is inactive, this suggests that plants must have adequate levels of MeIAA methylesterase activity to convert exogenously applied MeIAA to IAA. Endogenous MeIAA, like methyl salicylate |CITS:[17916738]|, may be a transport form of the hormone that is moved from its site of production to a site of auxin activity and then transformed into active IAA by methylesterases  |CITS:[18467465]|.
/
/MeIAA is difficult to detect in plants |CITS:[16169896][18467465]|, and this compound only accumulates at very low levels in Arabidopsis |CITS:[18367217]| however it has been observed in a number of plant species (catalogued in <A href="http://kanaya.naist.jp/knapsack_jsp/information.jsp?sname=C_ID&word=C00000101">KNApSAcK</A>). In addition, the phenotypic effects caused by changes the levels of IAMT or MES activity in plants argue that this pathway is important for normal plant growth and development |CITS:[16169896][18467465]|. 
/
/Additional work will be needed to clarify the biological role of MeIAA and to identify the taxonomic distribution of this pathway that can reversibly methylate an important regulator of plant growth, development, and environmental response.
/
/Please note:  Neither MeIAA nor MeIAA methylesterase activity have been experimentally verified in <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> or <i>Picea glauca</i> even though both have active IAA methyltransferases |CITS: [17499822][19369216]| . However, it seems likely that the back reaction occurs. Notably, <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> and other <i>Picea</i> species do have predicted proteins with high similarity to the MeIAA methylesterase from Arabidopsis.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/L-Fucose is an important monosaccharide found in a diverse array of organisms.  It is a carbohydrate component of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, mammalian and plant glycoproteins (such as the human antigenic glycoproteins or glycolipids of erythrocyte membranes) and various plant cell wall polysaccharides.  It is found in xyloglucans and rhamnogalacturonans I and II.  Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form GDP-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as the donor substrate.
/
/The formation of UDP-Fuc occurs via two routes: a) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-Fuc from free L-fucose (this pathway), and b) a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route from GDP-D-mannose (|FRAME:PWY-66|).  
/
/In plants, biosynthesis of GDP-L-fucose is thought to occur mainly through <i>de novo</i> synthesis.  The primary role of the sugar salvage pathways is presumed to be in the recycling of sugars derived from the turnover of macromolecules such as polysaccharides, galactolipids and proteoglycans, which have sugar components. Although the presence of GDP-L-fucose pyrophosphorylase activity in sycamore cell cultures and corn roots has been suggested |CITS:[5704313],[646802]| no enzyme of this pathway have yet been described in plants.

/|CITS: [18356490]|. Characterization of plants with mutations in the two adjacent genes coding

/
/The functional importance of this pathway is still under investigation.
/The three thalianol-related metabolites can be identified in Arabidopsis roots and

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/This pathway is widely spread, and is found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya.

/by |FRAME: ACS-MONOMER| |CITS:[11409546]|.
/
/In yeasts, respiratory dissimilation of |FRAME:PYRUVATE| is initiated by its conversion into

/
/Acetate plays multiple roles in the metabolism of |FRAME: TAX-83333|.  In the absence of other substrates

COMMON-NAME - glutamate removal from folates
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Folates are required in a variety of reactions (known as one-carbon metabolism) in both bacterial and mammalian tissues, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides. 
/
/During folate biosynthesis the enzyme |FRAME:EC-6.3.2.12|, adds an |FRAME:GLT| residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATEREDUCT-MONOMER| to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or THF) (see |FRAME: FOLSYN-PWY|). THF can then be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]| (see |FRAME: PWY-2201|).
/
/However, most folate molecules are further modified in cells by successive additions of |FRAME:GLT| residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates) (see |FRAME: PWY-2161|). Most of the glutamate residues are added by &gamma;-carboxy-linked polyglutamylation via an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are different from the more common &alpha;-carboxyl-linked amide bonds, they are not hydrolyzed by most peptidases or proteases. 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As vertebrates are not able to synthesize folate <i>in vivo</i>, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydrofolate"| (<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) and |FRAME: FORMYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| (<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|.
/
/In animals, during the absorption of food folates, which are usually polyglutamylated, the folate derivatives are hydrolyzed to a mono-glutamate level prior to transport by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-3.4.19.9|. The monoglutamylated forms are then metabolized within the enterocyte into 5-methyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This monoglutamyl folate coenzyme is the plasma form of the vitamin |CITS: [13906633][2736319]|, and is transported to peripheral tissues where it is demethylated by the vitamin B12-dependent |FRAME:ENZRXN-5465| to monoglutamyl tetrahydrofolate (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>).
/
/&gamma;-Glutamyl hydrolases were characterized from multiple sources, and exhibit either endo- or exopeptidase activity, depending on the organism and tissue of origin |CITS: [6547136]|. In mammals they are often lysosomal with an acidic pH optimum |CITS: [2174100]|.  The enzyme is often sulfhydryl and zinc dependent |CITS: [2867095][2341911]|, may be heavily glycosylated |CITS: [1150668][8343522]|, and has molecular mass between 50 and 150 kDa.

/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Polyacylated anthocyanins are widespread among flowering plants |CITS: [HONDA02]| as exemplified by |FRAME: CPD-7142| (this pathway) |CITS: [KONDO89]| and |FRAME: CPD-7708| (|FRAME:PWY-5284|) |CITS: [TAKEDA86]|, which are found in Labiatae and by |FRAME:CPD-7700| |CITS: [NAKAYAMA97]|, which has been detected in the Asteraceae.
/
/The varying flower coloration of |FRAME: TAX-21880| has been investigated and found to be dependent on the distribution of anthocyanins, or more precisely of the backbone compounds that formed those anthocyanins. Red to pink-coloured flowers contain pelargonidin derived anthocyanins whereas blue and violet flowers are composed of delphinidin and cyanidin building blocks, respectively |CITS: [11809447]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-7142 Salvianin|, the predominant anthocyanin causing the scarlet flower coloration of |FRAME: TAX-180675| has two malonyl groups linked to the 4" and 6"-hydroxyl groups of the 5-glucosyl moiety |CITS: [11809447]| |CITS: [KONDO89]|. 
/Its biosynthesis represents a species-specific variety of the decoration of pelargonin (compare |FRAME:PWY-5139|) that involves glucosylation and aromatic and aliphatic acylation to increase stability, solubility and color variation of the chromophoric anthocyanins |CITS: [10066805]| |CITS: [10845463]| |CITS: [Heller94]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Pelargonidin 3-<i>O</i>-&beta;-<i>D</i>-glucoside represents the starting compound that is stepwise converted into bisdemalonylsalvianin, the precursor for the aliphatic acylation with malonyl-CoA. Those reactions involve 5-<i>O</i>-glucosylation |CITS: [10066805]| and 3-aromatic acylation with caffeic acid |CITS: [Fujiwara98]| |CITS: [10845463]| which may proceed via two parallel pathway branches. The exact metabolic succession is not known and possibly will depend on the species involved.

/Bisdemalonylsalvianin is further malonylated twice on its 5-O-glucosidic moiety which is carried out by two different regio-specific malonyltransferases |CITS: [11598135]| |CITS: [15165190]|. Both acyltransferases belong to the BAHD group |CITS: [16616872]| that constitutes a large family of acyl CoA-utilizing enzymes of high catalytic versatility which often includes numerous homologs of unknown biochemical functions |CITS: [10712525]|. Although acetyltransferases show low similarities with each other they possess highly conserved sequences indicating the evolvement from a common ancestral gene |CITS: [9681034]|.
/
/The reaction mechanism of the first enzyme, i.e. malonyl-CoA: anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-6'''-O-malonyltransferase (Ss5MaT1) producing monodemalonylsalvianin has been studied in detail revealing a ternary complex mechanism where both substrates and the enzyme must form a complex before catalysis can take place |CITS: [12578391]|.
/The second malonylation forming salvianin is catalyzed by malonyl CoA: anthocyanin 5-O-glucoside-4'''-O-malonyltransferase (Ss5MaT2), an enzyme that despite its close substrate similarity evolved from a different branch of the BAHD family |CITS: [15165190]|. This enzyme is more related to acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT) and 
/thus differs from Ss5MaT1 associated with the anthocyanin acyltransferase (AAT) family.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Cyanide is a byproduct of the biosynthesis of the plant hormone |FRAME:ETHYLENE-CMPD|. The oxidation of the immediate precursor of ethylene, i.e. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid produces cyanide which is converted to &beta;-cyanoalanine |CITS:[16593463]| which is channeled towards asparagine biosynthesis (see |FRAME:ASPSYNII-PWY|). &beta;-cyanoalanine has also been found to be an effective defense molecule against a variety of predators |CITS:[5784950]|.
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Because of the catalytic activity of &beta;-cyanoalanine synthase cyanide does not accumulate in plants but is metabolized and directed towards the formation of |FRAME:ASN|. The enzyme catalyzing the formation of the non-protein amino acid beta-cyanoalanine from cysteine and cyanide, i.e. &beta;-cyanoalanine synthase has been partially purified and characterized in spinach and <Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS:[10889265]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes both the carboxylation and oxygenation of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2| (RuBP).  The carboxylation process is generally known as CO<SUB>2</SUB> fixation (this pathway) whereas the oxygenation process is known as photorespiration (|FRAME:PWY-181|).
/
/This pathway is the only pathway in plants that can catalyze the net fixation of CO<SUB>2</SUB>.  Indeed, globally through the action of the metabolic process, three molecules CO<SUB>2</SUB> are combined along with one <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> into a three-carbon sugar phosphate (|FRAME:GAP| and |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, which interconvert and are also known as triose-P) |CITS:[BOWYER97]|.  This cycle occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts.  It is composed of 13 reactions catalyzed by 11 enzymes.  The pathway has three distinct phases: (i) one of the major steps of the pathway is the <i>carboxylation</i> of RuBP by Rubisco into two molecules of |FRAME:G3P|; (ii) the <i>reduction</i> of |FRAME:G3P| into triose-P; and (iii) the <i>regeneration</i> of the primary acceptor RuBP.  As a result, it takes three turns of the cycle to generate one net molecule of triose-P.
/
/This triose-P can have several fates: it can be used (i) to generate more RuBP (five turns of the cycle will generate an additional RuBP molecule if triose-P is reinvested); (ii) to produce starch in the chloroplast (see |FRAME:PWY-622|); (iii) to produce sucrose (see |FRAME:PWYQT-4428|); or (iv) to be converted into |FRAME:G3P|, thereby generating ATP and reductant [NAD(P)H] (<b>Note:</b>  the latter two conversions occur in the cytosol and require triose-P to be exported from the chloroplast via the phosphate translocator in exchange from <i>P<sub>i</sub></i> from the cytosol).
/
/The Calvin cycle has many regulatory points of control, some of which are reviewed in |CITS:[Bowyer97]|.  Three factors will be noted here that determine the rate of cycling of the pathway: (i) the rate of utilization of triose-P for the synthesis of carbohydrates and other compounds, (ii) light by way of the electron transport at the level of the redox regulation by the thioredoxin system, the modulation of enzymatic activity by NADPH and ATP, and changes in stromal pH and Mg<sup>2+</sup>; and (iii) the regulation of Rubisco by CO<sub>2</sub> (of which the regulation by |FRAME:CPDQT-10| is an element; see |FRAME:PWYQT-4433|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Plants accumulate and mobilize |FRAME: Starch starch| in both photosynthetic tissue (leaves) and non-photosynthetic storage tissues (such as tuber and seed endosperm). In leaves, starch is synthesized during the light period and is degraded during the dark period. In storage tissues, starch is degraded during tuber sprouting and seed germinating. Except for seed endosperm where starch degradation occurs in an acellular tissue, starch degradation generally occurs in the plastids (chloroplast of leaves and amyloplast of tubers) where starch accumulates. Isoforms of the starch degradation enzymes are also found and in many cases abundant in extra-plastidic subcellular locations in leaves and tubers. Their physiological functions are not well understood |CITS: [20192737]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In leaves, starch biosynthesis leads to the formation of granules in the chloroplast stroma during the light period and the granules are degraded during the dark period. The starch granules have very complex structures. |FRAME: Starch Starch| is composed of two different polyglucan chains, |FRAME: CPD-7043 amylopectins| and |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses &alpha;-amyloses|. The |FRAME: CPD-7043 amylopectin| chains form double helices that are tightly packed in layers of crystalline lamellae. Starch degradation must proceed from the outside of these granules and requires the disruption of the tight association between amylopectin chains |CITS: [20192737]|.
/
/Recent work has helped to reveal multiple enzymes that are involved in making the exterior polyglucan chains on the starch polymers more accessible to hydrolytic degradation. Notably, in Arabidopsis two enzymes, |FRAME: AT1G10760-MONOMER glucan, water dikinase| (GWD) |CITS: [16914145][17666166]| and |FRAME: AT5G26570-MONOMER phosphoglucan, water dikinase| (PWD) |CITS: [15686522][15618411]| sequentially catalyze the addition of phosphate to the C6 and then the C3 residues of glucosyl residues in the amylopectin chains to move them from an insoluble to a soluble state |CITS: [19325165][20192737]|. 
/The SEX4 |FRAME: AT3G52180-MONOMER glucan phosphatase| can help to make these soluble chains better substrates for the hydrolytic activity of &beta;-amylases by removing the phosphates residues |CITS: [20192737]|. 
/
/&beta;-amylases such as |FRAME: AT4G17090-MONOMER BAM3| remove maltose units from the &alpha;-1,4-linked unbranched chains of the amylopectin. Maltose is then transported out of the chloroplast for inclusion in various cytosolic sugar metabolism pathways.
/
/As |FRAME: AT4G17090-MONOMER BAM3| and other chloroplastic &beta;-amylases release maltose from the exposed chains, they eventually encounter branch points introduced by &alpha;-1,6-linked glucosyl residues. Glucoses linked in this manner are not substrates for &beta;-amylases so these enzymes cannot act on the exposed chains again until a debranching enzyme, such as |FRAME: AT4G09020-MONOMER isoamylase 3| (ISA3) removes the &alpha;-1,6 linkages. Chloroplastic &beta;-amylases can then continue to release maltose units for export. Malto-oligosaccharide chains containing fewer than four glucosyl residues can be acted on by  |FRAME: AT5G64860-MONOMER DPE1|  or other chloroplastic disproportionating enzymes to release glucose. This glucose is also be transported to the cytosol for use in sugar metabolism |CITS: [20192737]|.
/
/Though it is not depicted in this pathway, Chloroplastic &beta;-amylases enzymes also likey act on any &alpha;-1,4-linked-malto-oligosaccharide chains that are free in the stroma that contain at least four glucose residues |CITS: [20192737]|. 
/
/In some species, including |FRAME: TAX-3055 <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>| |CITS: [17018036]|and |FRAME: TAX-4530 <i>Oryza sativa</i>| (rice) |CITS: [18621947]|, the |FRAME: Linear-Malto-Oligosaccharides malto-oligosaccharides| may also be broken down to |FRAME: GLC-1-P &alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate| by malto-oligosaccharide phosphorylase enzymes (see |FRAME: RXN-12392 reaction|). Although a chloroplastic enzyme with this activity can be found in Arabidopsis (|FRAME: AT3G29320-MONOMER PHS1|), there is no evidence that it actually participates in starch degradation in that species |CITS: [15173560]|. In general, the potential <i>in planta</i> role of these enzymes in starch degradation remains a matter of on-going debate and investigation |CITS: [20192737]|.

TYPES - Ammonia-Assimilation
COMMON-NAME - ammonia assimilation cycle II
CITATIONS - 14757761:EV-EXP:3579441422:dreher
COMMENT - The primary nitrogen assimilation routes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and prokaryotes are nitrogen fixation, nitrate assimilation, and ammonia assimilation.
/Ammonia is liberated by photorespiration, protein and amino acid metabolism, and the breakdown of nitrogen transport compounds. The rate of ammonia generation during photorespiration is about 10 times the rate of nitrate assimilation.
/
/The ammonia released from photorespiration is immediately re-assimilated via the ammonia assimilation cycle. The net result of this cycle is the conversion of one molecule of ammonia to one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one ATP molecule.
/
/The pathway includes two steps catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-4585 "glutamine synthetase"| (GS) and |FRAME: MONOMER-7421 "glutamate synthase"| (also known as <b>g</b>lutamine <b>o</b>xo<b>g</b>lutarate <b>a</b>mino<b>t</b>ansferase or GOGAT), and thus is often referred to as the GS/GOGAT pathway. Two types of GOGAT are known in photosynthetic organisms - NADH-dependent, and ferredoxin-dependent. NADH-GOGAT is found in the nucleus of vascular plants, fungi, and diatoms (see |FRAME: PWY-6963|). The ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is only found in Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes (this pathway). 
/
/An NADPH-dependent version of GOGAT is found in non-photosynthetic bacteria and archaea (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).

TYPES - UDP-Sugar-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - UDP-glucose biosynthesis
COMMENT - |FRAME: D-Glucose| is an extremely abundant monosaccharide that is used as an energy source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans. In humans D-glucose is the key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, but other organisms can also metabolize glucose by anaerobic respiration and fermentation.
/
/D-Glucose is also used as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances, such as |FRAME: CELLULOSE cellulose| and |FRAME: CELLULOSE chitin|. Many organisms store glucose as an energy and carbon reserve in the form of polymers such as |FRAME: Starch| and |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|.
/In addition, D-glucose is often added onto certain proteins and lipids through glycosylation, which is often critical for their functioning.
/
/The form of |FRAME: D-Glucose| used in biosynthesis is the activated sugar-nucleotide form, and usually the UDP-derived form |FRAME: CPD-12575|. This common activated form of glucose participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions in the cell, including the synthesis of many polysaccharaides (such as |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, |FRAME: Starch starch|, |FRAME: CPD-3602 laminarin| and |FRAME: CELLULOSE cellulose|), disaccharides (such as |FRAME: SUCROSE| and |FRAME: TREHALOSE|) and a very large number of &beta;-glucosides. It is also the starting molecule for the synthesis of many modified sugars that participate in the synthesis of surface polysaccharides such as the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigens| of Gram-negative bacteria and the S-layer of Gram-positive bacteria (see |FRAME: PWY-7328|).
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12575| can be converted by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-5.1.3.2| into |FRAME: CPD-14553|, which is a precursor for many polysaccharides on its own.
/
/It has been suggested that UDP-D-glucose can also act as an extracellular signaling molecule |CITS: [12695547]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Folates are involved in several important metabolic functions such as synthesis of methionine, pantothenate, purines and thymidylates. Folates are tripartite molecules composed of a pterin moiety, a |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE| unit, and a &gamma;-linked glutamate chain.
/
/In plants folate biosynthesis is segregated into three subcellular compartments; the |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE| moiety is produced in the plastids, as depicted in this pathway. The pteridine moiety is produced in the cytosol, and is condensed with |FRAME: P-AMINO-BENZOATE| ithin the mitochondria, followed by glutamylation and reduction to form |FRAME: THF|.

COMMENT - Protein prenylation is an important regulatory modification that can often affect the ability of proteins to interact with membranes or other proteins. Through a series of successive reactions, prenylated proteins typically end up with a C-terminal cysteine residue bearing a farnesylcysteine or geranylgeranylcysteine methyl ester. Therefore, during the process of prenylated protein degradation, |FRAME: CPD-12581 <i>S</i>-(2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl-L-cysteine| or |FRAME: CPD-12591 all-<i>trans</i>-geranylgeranylcysteine| are typically released |CITS: [17425716][19969520]|. The pathway depicted here shows a way that these isoprenylcysteine compounds can be recycled for further use in the cell while preventing the accumulation of potentially dangerous substances. For instance, free |FRAME: CPD-12581 <i>S</i>-(2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl-L-cysteine| can cause problems for cells by acting as a competitive inhibitor of regulatory isoprenylcysteine methyltransferases (ICMTs) that modify prenylated proteins |CITS: [19969520]|. And, |FRAME: 2-TRANS6-TRANS-FARNESOL 2-<i>trans</i>,</i>-6-<i>trans</i>-farnesol| can be toxic at high levels |CITS: [10938345]|. Meanwhile, |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP (2<i>E</i>,6</i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate| is an important compound used for protein prenylation, sterol biosynthesis, and sesquiterpene biosynthesis |CITS: [10557276]|.
/
/Although this pathway has been hypothesized to occur in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| and other important enzymatic activities associated with the pathway have been detected in |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>| and |FRAME: TAX-4120 <i>Ipomoea batatas</i>|, there is no direct evidence for all of the enzymes present in the pathway in any one species. It is also unclear what other species this pathway is likely to exist in. Given the widespread occurence of prenylated proteins and biosynthetic pathways that utilize |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP (2<i>E</i>,6</i>E</i>)-farnesyl diphosphate| in the plant kingdom, numerous plant species may use this pathway. However, there are alternative mechanisms for metabolizing |FRAME: CPD-12581 <i>S</i>-(2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl-L-cysteine| and farnesylcysteine methyl esters that depend on the activity of flavin-dependent monooxygenases or cysteine &Beta;-lyases shown to exist in pigs and rats |CITS:[8199308] [2318851]| which may also exist in some plants. Yeast also certainly generate farnesylated proteins |CITS: [1917931]|, but the fate of |FRAME: CPD-12581 <i>S</i>-(2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl-L-cysteine| and farnesylcysteine methyl esters in fungi is unknown. Currently, there is no evidence for the existence of this pathway in prokaryotes.
/
/Interestingly, blocks in early steps in this pathway can affect biological processes that depend on protein prenylation. For instance, |FRAME: CPD-693 abscisic acid (ABA)|-mediated signaling in |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| involves the targeted methylation of the farnesylcysteine residue on prenylated proteins via isoprenylcysteine methyltransferases (ICMTs). Normal ABA signaling is disrupted when mutants with lowered farnesylcysteine lyase activity have elevated levels of free |FRAME: CPD-12581 <i>S</i>-(2<i>E</i>,6<i>E</i>)-farnesyl-L-cysteine| that acts as a competitive inhibitor of ICMTs |CITS: [17425716][19969520]|.

COMMENT - Nicotianamine  (NA) is ubiquitous throughout the plant kingdom acting as general chelator and is implicated
/in the maintenance of iron (Fe) homeostasis |CITS:[Reichman02]|. Several studies have shown that nicotianamine
/is involved in long distance transport of metal ions and is directly associated with the regulation of metal
/transfer within cells |CITS:[12782722]|. Nicotianamine is present in all plant organs but is never secreted
/out. Thus, NA has a physiological role in iron-trafficking internally |CITS:[10069850]|.
/
/Studies with transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants have shown that nicotianamine
/affects flower morphogenesis at very low concentrations, normal flower development requires higher NA
/concentrations. Nicotianamine and iron are required for normal flower development |CITS:[12782722]|. 
/
/Several nicotianamine synthase genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, and the activity of three of 
/these enzymes has been confirmed through expression in E.coli and/or S.pombe |CITS:[Suzuki99]
/[14690510]|. NA can be detected in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS:[14690510]|. Expression of AtNAS2
/(AT5G56080) improves the Zn tolerance of a Zn-sensitive yeast strain. It is interesting to note that
/Arabidopsis halleri, the Zn- and Cd-hyperaccumulating relative of A. thaliana, expresses the AhNAS2
/gene at a high level in its roots and produces more NA than Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that the
/differential expression of this gene helps to explain the heavy metal tolerance of A. halleri |CITS:[14690510]|.

COMMENT - Cyanide may be produced in plants during a number of biochemical processes including cyanogenic glucoside degradation and
/|FRAME:ETHYL-PWY| (rev in |CITS: [Siegien06]|). Cyanide is quite toxic and plants need mechanisms to protect themselves
/from this compound. &beta;-cyanoalanine synthases appear to play a primary role in cyanide detoxification in
/plants (shown in the |FRAME: P401-PWY| pathway), however, other mechansims, such as the thiosulfanate disproportionation
/depicted in this pathway, may also be
/part of the cyanide detoxification process |CITS: [Siegien06]|. Although the majority of cyanide may be actively metabolised
/by plants, cyanide may also contribute to the regulation of several
/plant processes such as ethylene biosynthesis, nitrate assimiliation, and seed germination |CITS: [Siegien06]|.
/
/Arabidopsis plants have been shown to have thiosulfate sulfurtransferase activity that increases during the 5th and 6th week
/of the plant growth period |CITS: [17408957]|. Several sulfurtransferase enzymes have been shown to accept thiosulfate as a

/ST16 (|FRAME: AT5G66040-MONOMER|), however, based
/on their low activity with this substrate, these are not good candidates for participating in this pathway <i>in vivo</i> |CITS:
/[12482606][10951223]|. However,
/STR18 shows a high degree of activity <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [12482606]| and its expression levels are only detectable

COMMENT - Homogalacturonan (HGA) is a linear chain of 1,4-linked a-D-galacturonic acid residues in which some of the carboxyl groups are methyl esterified. HGA accounts for up to 60% of the pectin found in primary cell walls of all plants. The pectin network is systematically disassembled during many stages of plant development, especially those that require cell separation including fruit ripening, organ abscission, pod and anther dehiscence, and pollen grain maturation. Two major steps are involved in the homogalacturonan disassembling process that requires a methylesterase and a polygalacturonase. The methylesterase prepares deesterified domains of homogalacturonan that can become suitable for the action of polygalacturonase and other pectinolytic enzymes. The deesterified domains of homogalacturonan can also be cross-linked with calcium, resulting in gel formation which contributes to intercellular adhesion.

COMMENT - The phytohormone family of auxins regulates many plant biological processes including cell division, elongation,
/differentiation, root initiation, tropic responses, flowering, fruit ripening, and senescence |CITS:[15749753]|. 
/|FRAME: INDOLE_ACETATE_AUXIN "Indole-3-acetic acid"| (IAA) is the most abundant natural plant auxin.
/
/This is the main tryptophan-dependent pathway for auxin biosynthesis in |FRAME: TAX-3702| and most likely other plants as well |CITS: [22025724][22155950]|. Prior to the work of |CITS: [22025724]|, each of the 2 reactions in this pathway were believed to participate in separate tryptophan-dependent pathways for auxin synthesis, one involving |FRAME: INDOLE_PYRUVATE| (IPA) and one involving a |FRAME: TRYPTAMINE| intermediate (see |FRAME: PWY-581| for a diagram that integrates the various pathways that have been suggested for IAA biosynthesis). However, it has now been shown that both enzymes participate in a simple pathway that generates |FRAME: INDOLE_ACETATE_AUXIN| from |FRAME:TRP| in two steps |CITS: [22025724]|. 
/
/Studies of |FRAME:TAX-3701| mutants indicate that |FRAME: INDOLE_ACETALDEHYDE|, previously considered an intermediate in the conversion of IPA to IAA, is not formed |CITS: [22025724]|. The pathway has been confirmed in several ways, including expression of  the |FRAME:TAX-3701| |FRAME: AT4G13260| protein in <i>E coli</i> |CITS: [22025724]|.
/
/Mutations in the orthologous maize genes |FRAME: GDQC-114715| and |FRAME: GDQC-111218| greatly reduce auxin levels and have severe phenotypes, indicating that this pathway is important in maize as well |CITS: [18799737][21335375]|. Double |FRAME: GDQC-114715|/|FRAME: GDQC-111218| mutants have the same reduction in auxin levels as the |FRAME: GDQC-111218| single mutant, supporting the conclusion that these genes function in the same pathway |CITS: [21335375]|.

/Biotin biosynthesis is found in plants, bacteria (see |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYNTHESIS-PWY|) and certain fungi.
/Although animals and most fungi cannot synthesize their own biotin, a daily intake is required for normal growth and

/
/
/<b>About this pathway</b>: 
/
/The biotin pathway has been investigated using biotin-auxotroph mutants of bacteria and
/<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In Arabidopsis it could be shown that two enzymes correspond to certain mutations
/ <i>bio1</i>  which has been shown to encode the biotin biosynthetic enzyme 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid
/aminotransferase |CITS: [8676868]| and <i>bio2</i> which encodes for the biotin synthase |CITS: [8680961]|.
/
/Biotin synthase is regarded as a key enzyme of the pathway. Despite of extensive studies the catalytic mechanism
/of this last step remains enigmatic and all the components involved in the reaction are not known yet.
/The reaction involves the insertion of a sulfur atom between the C 6 and C 9 of the imidazolidone ring of
/dethiobiotin and requires <i>S</i>-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) and a physiological reduction system to
/assemble the thiophene ring of biotin |CITS: [0009501126]|.  
/
/During the reaction a radical species is generated by the reductive cleavage of AdoMet to introduce sulfur into
/dethiobiotin |CITS: [11322938][12714594]|. The source of the sulfur in plants is not yet established but it has been
/proposed that biotin synthase itself may act as immediate sulfur donor hence proposing that biotin synthase is
/a reactant as well as a catalyst |CITS: [9920791]|. However, the biotin synthase activity could be clearly demonstrated
/in Arabidopsis utilizing the synthase and accessory proteins from <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [11706201]|. It has been shown
/that mitochondrial components are necessary for the function of the enzyme, acting similar to the flavodoxin
/reduction system found in <i>E. coli</i>. The mitochondrial components identified were adrenodoxin, adrenodoxin
/reductase and cystein desulfurase (Nfs1) which proved to be essential for the plant biotin synthase reaction and
/accommodates the cellular location of the enzyme |CITS: [12714594]|. 
/
/While the plant pathway is very similar to the bacterial one, a stable intermediate (9-mercaptodethiobiotin)
/was identified from cell cultures of lavender which differs from the pathway found in bacterial cells |CITS: [8223585]|. 
/This compound is involved in the last step in biotin biosynthesis. The reaction, catalyzed by biotin synthase, is very 
/complex and not yet fully understood. Furthermore, biotin synthase is the only enzyme of the pathway which has been
/ investigated in plants on the molecular level |CITS: [8680961][9428635][11706201][12714594]|.
/
/The enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of the biotin biosynthesis, i.e.  8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase 
/(AtbioF) is localised in the cytosol and not in the mitochondrium as is the last enzyme of the pathway biotin synthase. 
/That strongly indicates that this pathway is compartimentalized which is also in contrast to the bacterial variant 
/|CITS: [16299174]|. This complex spatial organization of biotin metabolism is comparable to the tetrahydrofolate 
/biosynthesis (|FRAME:PWY-3742|), another vitamin synthesized only by plants and microorganisms.

TYPES - Detoxification
COMMON-NAME - glutathione-mediated detoxification II
CITATIONS - 18522943:EV-EXP:3521830939:peifenz
COMMENT - Glutathion plays an important role in cellular redox control and detoxification of heavy metals, electrophilic xenobiotics, and toxic side products of normal plant metabolism.  The detoxification process starts with the formation of glutathione conjugates (GS-conjugates). This occurs in the cytosol. The subsequent degradation of GS-conjugates may occur in either cytosol or vacuole. In Arabidopsis, the degradation routes are different in the two subcellular locations. In the vacuole, the initial step of GS-conjugates degradation is catalyzed by &gamma;-glutamyl transpeptidase, which removes the N-terminal glutamate residue |CITS: [17561001]|. This is also found to be the case in GS-conjugates degradation in human and animals. In the cytosol, however, the process starts with removal of the C-terminal glycine |CITS: [12620355]|. So far this is only found in higher plants. Nonetheless, both routes lead to the common intermediate Cys-S-conjugates. Less is known about further degradation of Cys-S-conjugates. A major enzyme activity has been detected in an Arabidopsis cell culture that is involved in malonylation of Cys-S-conjugates to form N-malonyl-Cys-S-conjugates |CITS: [18522943]|. In contrast, in human and animals, Cys-S-conjugates are acetylated to form N-acetyl-Cys-S-conjugates. In the Arabidopsis cell culture, a small portion of Cys-S-conjugates were converted to methyl thiolethers by the concerted action of a C-S lyase and a methyltransferase |CITS: [18522943]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In prokaryotes and eukaryotes the four-carbon amino acid aspartate is converted to the corresponding keto acid 
/oxaloacetate by transamination using &alpha;-ketoglutarate as acceptor of the amino group.  This reversible 
/reaction also biosynthesizes aspartate (see pathway |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  Oxaloacetate is a 
/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate, as shown in the pathway link.  Oxaloacetate can also be 
/converted by phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxykinase to phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate for use in 
/gluconeogenesis (see pathway |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY|).  Aspartate is therefore a link between amino acid 
/and carbohydrate metabolism.  In addition, aspartate is a precursor for the biosynthesis of many other compounds 
/including lysine, threonine, methionine and NAD<sup>+</sup> 
/(see |FRAME: PWY0-781| and |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  
/
/There are also several other routes for aspartate degradation.  In mammals and most land vertebrates, aspartate 
/can be degraded by entering the urea cycle at the point of citrulline, and is ultimately converted to fumarate 
/(see pathway |FRAME: PWY-4984|).  In another eukaryotic route, aspartate is degraded to malate as part of the 
/reversible malate-aspartate shuttle found in liver, heart and kidney.  This is one of several shuttle mechanisms 
/used to transfer electrons from cytosolic NADH produced by glycolysis into the mitochondrion, because NADH 
/itself cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane (see pathway 
/|FRAME: MALATE-ASPARTATE-SHUTTLE-PWY|).  In prokaryotes, aspartate can be degraded to 
/fumarate by |FRAME: ASPARTASE-CPLX| (see pathway |FRAME: GLUTDEG-PWY|).  |CITS: [VOET04]|

/<b>General information on carotenoids:</b> 
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic reaction 
/centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80] [YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize carotenoids, although 
/they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids pigments are lipid-soluble and are 
/involved in a variety of functions including: protection against photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of 
/excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments; light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as 
/zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring 
/agents in flowers and fruits to attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; 
/finally they are precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the 
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided in two major 
/groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as lycopene, 
/&alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy, keto or hydroxyl groups) 
/of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition varies from species to species; the 
/concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light intensity and the accumulation of specific 
/carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly, developmentally regulated process  
/|CITS:[12232210][8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are observed during fruit ripening (for review, s
/ee |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and 
/neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound photosystems |CITS:[1885603][RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is 
/generally found in the reaction center where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll 
/and singlet oxygen, and can undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.  Adjacent to 
/the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found 
/|CITS:[1885603][8444169]|.  Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin 
/and neoxanthin) |CITS:[1885603][8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the 
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other structures 
/within the stroma.
/
/<b>General information on lettuce carotenoids:</b> 
/
/In addition to &alpha;- and &beta;-rings, plants also contain carotenoids with &epsilon;-rings.  Carotenoids with 
/one &beta;- and one &epsilon;-ring are relatively common and include lutein, one of the predominant carotenoid in 
/the light-harvesting antenna of most green plants.  Carotenoids with two &epsilon;-rings, on the other hand, are 
/not commonly found in plants and algae other than in trace amounts.  Members of the |FRAME:TAX-4210| family, 
/such as lettuce, present an exception.  In those species, the two &epsilon;-ringed carotenoid lactucaxanthin has 
/been detected in the light-harvesting complex of photosystem II where it can represent between 20 to 30% of the 
/total thylakoid carotenoids |CITS:[PHILLIP95]| and has therefore been postulated to play an important role in 
/light-harvesting.  A lycopene &epsilon;-cyclase responsible for the addition of a &epsilon;-ring at both ends of 
/lycopene has been cloned from |FRAME:TAX-4236| |CITS:[11226339]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE "Thiamin diphosphate"|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism. It is an essential cofactor for a variety of enzymes such as |FRAME: TRANSKETOI-CPLX transketolase|, |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX "pyruvate dehydrogenase"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6956 "pyruvate decarboxylase"|, and |FRAME: CPLX66-42 "&alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase"| |CITS:[15326535]|. Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/Thiamin is synthesized <i>de novo</i> by microorganisms, plants and some lower eukaryotes (e.g. |FRAME: TAX-5820|), but not by higher eukaryotes, which must obtain it through their diet.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: THIAMINE-P "Thiamin phosphate"| is formed by the coupling of two moieties, the pyrimidine |FRAME:AMINO-HYDROXYMETHYL-METHYLPYRIMIDINE-PP| and the thiazole |FRAME: THZ-P|, which are produced by two different pathways. This pathway describes the formation of the thiazole moiety in eukaryotes.
/
/Genetic studies in |FRAME: TAX-4932| have demonstrated that THI4 is the only gene required for thiamin thiazole
/formation |CITS: [7941734]|. The protein, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, copurified with its product (|FRAME: CPDQT-400 "adenylated thiazole"|) and two additional adenylated intermediates that shed light on its complex mechanism |CITS: [18652458]|. Similarly, in the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| the multifunctional protein |FRAME: AT5G54770| is sufficient for thiazole production. While it has been shown that NAD and |FRAME: GLY| are substrates for the enzyme, the exact source of sulfur is still not known.

/The TH1 protein localizes to the chloroplasts, suggsting that this part of the pathway occurs in this organelle |CITS:[18048325][18332905][17174261][11575719]|. However, THI1 can also localize to the mitochondria |CITS:[11575719]|, and the downstream TPK1 and TPK2 enzymes are both cytosolic in Arabidopsis |CITS:[17611796]|, suggesting that intermediates in the vitamin B1 biosynthesis pathway may need to be transported out of organelles for |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE| synthesis to be completed.

COMMON-NAME - very long chain fatty acid biosynthesis II
CITATIONS - 16950653:EV-EXP-IDA:3543777155:caspi
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Fatty-Acids "Fatty acids"| are carboxylic acids with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID n-butanoate| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6-12 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13-21 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 carbons or longer.
/
/Very-long-chain fatty acids are components of eukaryotic cells and are involved in many different physiological functions in different organisms. They are abundant in some tissues, for example as constituents of myelin in the brain or of storage triacylglycerols in plant seeds, and are components of plant cuticular waxes |CITS: [14581464]| (see |FRAME: PWY-282 cuticular wax biosynthesis|), of sphingolipids |CITS: [16730802]|, and of the lipid barrier of the skin. They are also involved in the pathways for protein trafficking and for the synthesis of the glycosylphostphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor |CITS: [16980694]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/VLCFAs are synthesized in eukaryotes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a membrane-bound enzyme complex known as the elongase |CITS: [10907783]|. This complex catalyzes the sequential additions of C2 moieties from |FRAME: MALONYL-COA malonyl-CoA| to preformed C18 acyl groups derived from the <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Each elongation cycle is composed of 4 reactions: condensation of |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs a long-chain acyl-CoA| and |FRAME: MALONYL-COA malonyl-CoA| to form |FRAME: 3-KETOACYL-COA a 3-oxoacyl-CoA|, reduction to
/|FRAME: 3-HYDROXYACYL-COA a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA|, dehydration to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-COA a <i>trans</i>-2-enoyl-CoA|, and a final reduction to yield a chain-elongated fatty acyl-CoA |CITS: [16950653][16564093]|.

/While the reactions catalyzed by the elongase are similar to those of <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-5994 palmitate biosynthesis I (animals)| and |FRAME: PWY-5971 palmitate biosynthesis II (bacteria and plants)|), there are several differences between the elongase complex and the fatty acid synthase (FAS) complex. In animals and yeast all of the functions of FAS are present in either one (mammals) or two (yeast) large multidomain subunits (see |FRAME: CPLX-7628 "human fatty acid synthase"| and |FRAME: CPLX-7627 "yeast fatty acid synthase"|). The elongase, on the other hand, is composed of four enzymes that catalyze independent reactions, similarly to the bacterial/plants FAS systems. In addition, the elongase always utilizes |FRAME: MALONYL-COA malonyl-CoA| as the C2 donor unit, while FAS uses either malonyl-CoA (in yeast and animals) or |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP "amlonyl-[acp]"| in bacteria and plants. 
/
/The elongase accepts long-chain fatty acids [usually |FRAME: PALMITATE palmitate|(C16) or |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID stearate| (C18)] made by the cytosolic fatty acid synthase complex, and produces |FRAME: ARACHIDIC_ACID arachidate| (C20), |FRAME: DOCOSANOATE behenate| (C22), |FRAME: TETRACOSANOATE lignocerate| (C24), |FRAME: CPD-7832 cerotate| (26) or even longer acids. 
/
/The four enzymes that form the elongase complex are |FRAME: MONOMER-17330 very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase| or condensing enzyme |CITS:  [11341960]|, |FRAME: MONOMER-17329 very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase|, |FRAME:MONOMER-17327 very-long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase| and |FRAME: MONOMER-17328 very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase|.
/While only one enzyme catalyzes each of the last three reactions of the cycle (respectively), the first step (the condensation of the 2 carbons from malonyl-CoA to the nascent acyl-CoA) is catalyzed by several different enzymes, each of which has a different preference for its substrates (for example, in yeast both the |FRAME: G-15115 ELO2| and |FRAME: G-15116 ELO3| genes encode condensing enzymes that participate in the elongase complex). These enzymes, which are also the rate-limiting step in the cycle, thus determine the length of the final acyl-CoA produced by the complex they participate in |CITS: [11113186]|.

COMMENT - Brassinosteroids are steroidal hormones that regulate the growth and development of plants. Brassinosteroids are C<sub>27</sub>, C<sub>28</sub> and C<sub>29</sub> steroids depending on their C-24 alkyl substituents. More than 50 free, naturally occurring brassinosteroids have been identified in plants, of which brassinolide (BL) is the most biologically active C<sub>28</sub>, and together with its C<sub>28</sub> congeners, is distributed widely in the plant kingdom |CITS:[15012241]|. The biosynthesis pathway of brassinolide was initially elucidated using cultured <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> cells. Extensive metabolic studies suggested parallel-branched brassinolide pathways, namely the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways |CITS:[14502988]|. It has proposed that the late C-6 oxidation pathway plays a predominant role in the light, whereas the early C-6 oxidation pathway is dominant in the dark |CITS: [10982435]|. Recent studies suggest that there is a crosstalk between these parallel pathways, implying that they are not totally autonomous. The operation of an early C-22 oxidation branch of the brassinosteroid biosynthetic pathway has also been demonstrated (see |FRAME:PWY-2582 brassinosteroid biosynthesis II|) |CITS:[12376657]|. Thus, brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathways are highly networked. The identification of <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutants defective in enzymes of the various branches of the brassinosteroids biosynthesis pathway has been instrumental in the elucidation of the many steps of the biosynthesis of those compounds.
/Those mutants often display a dwarf phenotype. Although the current evidence indicates that both the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways are common in the plant kingdom, as seen in plants such as rice, pea and zinnia |CITS:[11161013],[12223591],[12445121]|, it appears that in tomato and tobacco the late C-6 oxidation pathway is predominant as endogenous brassinosteroids of these species comprise only members of this branch |CITS:[11551544],[10631252],[9990098]|.
/A putative brassinosteroid receptor has been described: BRI1 |CITS: [11268216]|.
/Although many of the genes encoding brassinosteroid biosynthetic enzymes have been cloned using brassinosteroid biosynthetic mutants, with the exception of the enzymes encoded by <i>DWF4</i> and <i>DET2</i>, few have been expressed and purified.

COMMENT - Not much was known about alanine metabolism in plants until fairly recently. It has been shown that alanine is produced in large amounts and becomes one of the most abundant amino acids in plant roots under hypoxic conditions, and that alanine concentration decreases after the plants were returned to normal oxygen conditions. It is hypothesized that during hypoxia, alanine production maybe an effective mechanism used by plants to conserve nitrogen and carbon atoms that otherwise would be lost by anaerobic fermentation. Upon return to normal oxygen conditions, alanine degradation releases the stored nitrogen and carbon pools.   
/
/alanine:oxoglutarate aminotransferase (AOAT) catalyzes a reversible reaction that is involved in both biosynthesis and degradation of alanine. The Arabidopsis genome has a gene family of four AOAT genes. Two of them, AOAT1 and AOAT2 (GGAT1 and GGAT2, respectively) were shown, by in vitro assay using recombinant proteins, have four aminotransferase activities, namely glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase, glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase and AOAT. The two recombinant proteins exhibited very similar Km values towards amino acid substrates glutamate and alanine, as well as the oxoacid substrates glyoxylate, pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate. Among the four enzyme activities, glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase and alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase activities were most drastically reduced in the AOAT1 knock-out plants indicating AOAT1 is primarily involved in photorespiration. In agreement with this, the enzyme is located in peroxisomes. 
/
/AOAT3 (AlaAT2) is predicted located in the mitochondrion. AOAT4 (AlaAT1) is located in the cytosol. Expression of these genes is induced under hypoxic conditions. Comparison of the AOAT4 knock-out mutants with wild type plants for alanine concentration changes over hypoxic stress and the subsequent recovery indicated that AOAT4 is primarily involved in alanine breakdown during recovery from low oxygen stress. Alanine biosynthesis under hypoxia does not require AOAT4 activity.
/
/The in vivo role of AOAT2 and AOAT3 is not clear.

COMMENT - An Arabidopsis cytochrome P450, CYP77A4, was shown to catalyze expoxidation of free fatty acids, the first one of its kind characterized in plants |CITS: [19120447]|. The epoxides can be further metabolized by epoxide hydrolases and fatty acid hydroxylases to diols and poly-hydroxy fatty acids. Some of the derived metabolites are cutin monomers, i.e. 18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxystearate (see |FRAME: PWY-321 cutin biosynthesis|), some others have antifungal properties possibly involved in plant defense, i.e. 12,13,17-trihydroxyoctadeca-9-enoate |CITS: [Hou2000]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Triacyglycerols (TAG) from vegetable oils are a major source of essential fatty acids in human diet, namely polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) linoleate (18:2) and linolenate (18:3). In oilseeds, TAG is synthesized via the |FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY "Kennedy pathway"|, where the precursor diacylglycerol (DAG) is de novo synthesized from glycerol-3-phosphate. In addition to the Kennedy pathway, there are several other |FRAME: PWY-6804 "paths"| supplying DAG for TAG biosynthesis during seed development in plants |CITS: [19329563]|. They involve a reverse activity of CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferas, and/or a novel enzyme phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. Since further desaturation of 18:1 to form 18:2 and 18:3 occurs mainly in phosphatidylcholine (PC), these alternative paths can provide PC-derived DAG species which are enriched in PUFA for TAG synthesis. Further more, an acyl editing (acyl exchange) mechanism also exists that can further enrich PUFA in oilseed TAG |CITS: [19329563]|.

/Acyl exchange between acyl-CoA and PC has been detected in a number of plant species including microsomal preparations of developing safflower cotyledons |CITS: [6497849]| and developing soybean embryos |CITS: [19329563]|. Further experiments are required to reveal whether a reverse activity of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT, 2.3.1.23) or a phospholipase A (3.1.1.4, 3.1.1.32), or both are involved in acyl-CoA and lysophosphatidylcholine generation |CITS: [19329563]|.  In either case, PC-derived acyl-CoAs, which are rich in PUFA, can feed into the Kennedy pathway for TAG synthesis. Lysophosphatidylcholines can be converted back to PC to replenish the PC pool by the forward reaction of 2.3.1.23. In addition, in the forward reaction de novo synthesized acyl-CoAs can be incorporated into PC.

COMMENT - This pathway shares beginning steps with |FRAME: LYSINE-DEG2-PWY| up to the molecule glutaryl-CoA. In |FRAME: LYSINE-DEG2-PWY| crotonyl-CoA is subsequently generated from (E)-glutaconyl-CoA by enzyme EC 4.1.1.70. However, no such enzyme is known from plants. Recent studies in Arabidopsis instead showed that degradation of lysine leads to the generation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate |CITS: [23718121], [20501910], [24561575]|, which was subsequently converted to 2-oxoglutarate (shown in this pathway) by a known enzyme D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase |CITS: [19586914], [21296880]|.
/The pathway starts in the cytosol and requires an unknown mitochondrial membrane transporter. 
/
/The Arabidopsis mitochondrial D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase is stereospecific. It is a homodimer, contains one FAD per monomer |CITS: [19586914]|. An electron acceptor is needed for the enzyme activity. The purified enzyme had no activity with NAD(P) or cytochrome c |CITS: [19586914]|. The in-vivo electron acceptor is the ETF-ETFQO complex located at the mitochondrial inner membrane which then pass the electron onto the respiratory chain. The product 2-oxoglutarate enters the TCA cycle.

COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>  
/
/Carotenoids with cyclic ends are integral constituents of plants, algae and cyanobacteria photosynthetic
/reaction centers |CITS:[GOODWIN80],[YOUNG93]|.   Animals, including humans, cannot synthesize
/carotenoids, although they are an essential source of retinoids and vitamin A.  These isoprenoids
/pigments are lipid-soluble and are involved in a variety of functions including: protection against
/photooxidative stress through energy-dissipation of excess light absorbed by the antenna pigments;
/light-harvest for photosynthesis; the prominent lutein, as well as zeaxanthin, are involved in the reduction
/of cataract and macular degeneration; others are exploited as coloring agents in flowers and fruits to
/attract pollinators (and in industry as food colorant) and agents of seed dispersal; finally they are
/precursors for the plant growth hormone abscisic acid and vitamin A (for a succinct review of the
/applications of carotenoids, see |CITS:[15012246]|).
/
/Carotenoids are C<sub>40</sub> isoprenoids which consist of eight isoprene units and can be divided
/in two major groups: carotene and xanthophylls.  Carotenes are linear or cyclized hydrocarbons such as
/lycopene, &alpha;-carotene and &beta;-carotene.  Xanthophylls are oxygenated derivatives (epoxy,
/keto or hydroxyl groups) of carotenes; for example: lutein, zeaxanthin.  The carotenoid composition
/varies from species to species; the concentration and composition of xanthophylls are affected by light
/intensity and the accumulation of specific carotenoids in fruit and flower chromoplasts is a highly,
/developmentally regulated process |CITS:[12232210],[8485401]|.  Important carotenoids variations are
/observed during fruit ripening (for review, see |CITS:[10205893]|).  Higher plant chloroplasts typically
/accumulate lutein, &beta;-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin in the thylakoid membrane-bound
/photosystems |CITS:[1885603],[RYBERG93]|.  &beta;-Carotene is generally found in the reaction center
/where it plays a critical photoprotective role by quenching triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen, and can
/undergo rapid degradation during photooxidation |CITS:[YOUNG93B]|.
/Adjacent to the reaction centers, in the core complex proteins, &beta;-carotene and lutein can be found
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.
/Finally, the surrounding antenna complexes contain xanthophylls (lutein, violaxanthin and neoxanthin)
/|CITS:[1885603],[8444169]|.  In the chromoplasts of ripening fruits and flower petals, and in the
/chloroplasts of senescing leaves, the carotenoids are found in membranes or in oil bodies or other
/structures within the stroma.
/
/<b>This pathway:</b>  
/
/Carotenes are oxygenated in various ways (hydroxylation, epoxydation, de-epoxidation) to
/form xanthophylls which comprise most of the carotenoid pigments in the thylakoid membranes.
/Hydroxylations play an important role in the oxygenation of carotenes and are catalyzed by hydroxylases
/acting specifically onto &beta; or &epsilon; rings.
/
/It has been postulated that the regulation of &epsilon;-cyclase, possibly through control of gene
/expression, determines xanthophylls composition in leaves and other plant tissues, since its products
/(&delta;-carotene) is destined to the &alpha;-carotene branch |CITS:[10205893]|.
/
/Zeaxanthin is one of the most common carotenoid alcohols found in nature. It is the pigment that gives
/corn, saffron, and many other plants their characteristic color. Zeaxanthin breaks down to form
/|FRAME: CPD-8668| and |FRAME: CPD-8669|, which are responsible for the taste and aroma of saffron.

COMMON-NAME - tetrahydrofolate salvage from 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate
CITATIONS - PMNAIPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis.
/Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|.
/
/Folates are abundant in green leaves, and folic acid was initially isolated from a large amount (four tons) of spinach leaves. The name folate is derived from the Latin <i>folium</i> (leaf) |CITS: [3067148]|.
/
/Folates are modified by the addition of glutamate moieties conjugated one to another via a series of &gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&gamma;-glutamyl tail. The polyglutamylated forms are usually preferred by the enzymes that use folates since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084][SCOTT00][KIRK94]|. In addition, in eukaryotic cells the glutamylated forms of folate facilitate the retention of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|.
/
/|FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>) is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions (see |FRAME: PWY-2201|), and the number of conjugated glutamate residues  (see |FRAME: PWY-2161|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/While plants and many microorganisms can synthesize folate coenzymes by the <i>de novo</i> synthesis pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-6612|), many of them are also capable of salvaging folate from different varieties, such as the 5,10-methenyl form, or the 5- or 10-formyl forms. This pathway describes the conversion of pre-existing |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF-GLU-N "5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate"| and |FRAME:FORMYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| to |FRAME: THF-GLU-N "tetrahydrofolate"|.
/
/As vertebrates are not able to synthesize folate <i>in vivo</i>, they are absolutely dependent on nutritional sources, making folate a vitamin. Food folates exist mainly as the polyglutamylated forms |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl-tetrahydrofolate"| and |FRAME:FORMYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyl-tetrahydrofolate"| (formyl-H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>n</sub>) |CITS: [405403]|. The polyglutamyl folates are first hydrolyzed to monoglutamate forms by |FRAME: HS06361-MONOMER|, and subsequently metabolized into |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF|. More about that process is found at the pathway |FRAME: PWY-2161B|.
/
/Insufficient supply of the vitamin in vertebrates leads to anemia in adults, and has been shown to cause neural tube malformation in human embryos |CITS: [11744531]|. In addition, folate defficiency has been linked to a number of other birth defects, several types of cancer, dementia, affective disorders, Down's syndrom, and serious conditions affecting pregnancy outcome (for a review, see |CITS: [11001804]|).

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Suberin is a polymeric plant cell wall constituent mainly found in the epidermal tissues of underground plant parts. Suberin consists of two domains, a polyaromatic and a polyaliphatic domain. The polyaromatics are predominately located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the primary cell wall and the plasmalemma. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. The exact qualitative and quantitative composition of suberin monomers varies in different species. The major monomers found in the potato tuber polyaliphatics are &omega;-hydroxyacids (mainly |FRAME: 18-HYDROXYOLEATE|) and &alpha;,&omega;-diacids (mainly |FRAME: OCTADEC-9-ENE-118-DIOIC-ACID|). The monomers of the polyaromatics are hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives. |FRAME: CPD-440| is a major aromatic monomer found in suberized potato tubers. In addition to the aromatics and aliphatics components, glycerol has been reported a major suberin component in potato. The role of glycerol is proposed to interlink aliphatic monomers, and possibly also to link polyaliphatics to polyaromatics, during suberin polymer assembly. The polymerization step of aromatic monomers has been shown to involve a peroxidase reaction.  
/
/Note that the biosynthesis of suberin aliphatic monomers shares the same upstream reactions with |FRAME: PWY-321|, and the biosynthesis of aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with lignin biosynthesis. Although both suberin and cutin contain aliphatic monomers, suberin differs from cutin by the chain length of aliphatic monomers, which can range from C16 to C32. 
/
/The pathway depicted here represents the biosynthesis of the major suberin monomers, namely |FRAME: 18-HYDROXYOLEATE|, |FRAME: OCTADEC-9-ENE-118-DIOIC-ACID|, and |FRAME: CPD-440|, characterized in potato, as well as very long chain aliphatic monomers found in many plants. It also shows the production of |FRAME: 16-HYDROXYPALMITATE|, a precursor of an important component of aromatic suberin in Arabidopsis  |CITS:[19759341][    19846769]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b> L-Rhamnose is a component of the plant cell wall pectic polysaccharides rhamnogalacturonan I and rhamnogalacturonan II and is also present in diverse secondary metabolites incliding anthocyanins, flavonoids and triterpenoids.
/Rhamnosyl transferases have been shown to utilize UDP-&beta;-L-rhamnose as the donor substrate |CITS: [1939145 ], [15020741]|, although in mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>), both dTDP-&beta;-L-Rhamnose and UDP-&beta;-L-rhamnose were reported to act as sugar donors for the rhamnosylation of flavonoids |CITS: [13864832 ]|.
/In general UDP-D-glucose is used in plants rather than dTDP-D-glucose as a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of L-rhamnose.
/<b>Pathway Characteristics:</b> Compared to the bacterial biosynthesis pathway of dTDP-L-rhamnose from dTDP-D-glucose which involves three enzymes (dehydratase, epimerase and reductase, see |FRAME:DTDPRHAMSYN-PWY| in MetaCyc), its plant homologue only has two steps, the latter two enzymatic activities (epimerase and reductase) being performed by one unique enzyme, NRS/ER |CITS: [15020741]|. To date the existence of a dTDP-D-glucose-4,6-dehydratase has not been experimentally proven in plants.

COMMENT - The three aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, derived from the common 
/precursor chorismate, are not only constituents of proteins but also precursors of many secondary 
/metabolites found in plants. There are two possible routes to synthesize phenylalanine from the 
/intermediate prephenate: via arogenate by the activity of prephenate aminotransferase (shown here) or 
/via phenylpyruvate by the activity of prephenate dehydratase. The 
/phenylpyruvate route has been confirmed in many microorganisms including E.coli and yeast. 
/However, compiling evidence suggests that many plants employ the arogenate route. There is so far 
/very little evidence for the phenylpyruvate route in plants. Prephenate dehydratase is generally not 
/detected in plants. 
/
/There are six genes in the Arabidopsis genome previously predicted as prephenate dehydratase based 
/on sequence similarity. Warpeha et al.|CITS: [16415218]| demonstrated that PD1, encoded by one of the six genes, has 
/prephenate dehydratase activity in vitro. However arogenate was not tested as an alternative 
/substrate in that study. Thus it was not clear whether or not prephenate is the preferred substrate. 
/Subsequently, Cho et al.|CITS: [17726025]| expressed all six genes in E. coli and analyzed enzyme activities 
/of the recombinant proteins. It was shown that three of them lack any detectable activity towards 
/prephenate, and the other three had significantly higher activity with arogenate than prephenate. 
/Consequently the six genes were re-annotated as arogenate dehydratase. The study provided further 
/evidence that phenylalanine biosynthesis in Arabidopsis proceeds via arogenate, not pheylpyruvate.
/
/Arogenate is the branch-point and the immediate precursor for the synthesis of both tyrosine and 
/phenylalanine. Arogenate dehydratase is the key enzyme channeling arogenate towards phenylalanine 
/synthesis. Studies in other plants showed that its activity is strongly feedback inhibited by 
/phenylalanine.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: GLN| is the amino group donor for many cellular biosynthetic reactions and serves as a storage reservoir 
/of ammonia, playing an important role in nitrogen metabolism.  In eukaryotes, |FRAME: GLN| is converted to 
/|FRAME: GLT| by glutaminase, the enzyme responsible for |FRAME: GLN| catabolism.  In plants, bacteria, and
/archaea, |FRAME: GLN| can also be converted to |FRAME: GLT| by the reversible glutamate synthase reaction,
/also known as GOGAT for glutamine: &alpha;-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (see pathway
/|FRAME: GLUTAMINEFUM-PWY|).  |CITS: [VOET04] [GOTTSCHALK1986]|
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/
/Wild-type |FRAME: TAX-83333| grows only poorly on |FRAME: GLN| as the sole source of carbon, although
/mutants that gain the ability to utilize |FRAME: GLN| can be isolated easily |CITS: [6115851]|.  In contrast,
/|FRAME: GLN| supports rapid growth as the sole source of nitrogen, although growth is biphasic with a transition
/in mid-log phase |CITS: [12218022]|.  No mutants unable to utilize |FRAME: GLN| as the sole source of nitrogen
/have been identified.
/
/Two enzymes able to degrade |FRAME: GLN|, |FRAME: GLUTAMINA-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLUTAMINB-CPLX|,
/were purified from |FRAME:TAX-562| B; no mutants were identified at the time, and thus the identity of the genes
/encoding them has not been established.  Recently, two genes encoding glutaminases with properties
/resembling those of glutaminase A and B have been identified in |FRAME: TAX-83333|

COMMENT - <b>General information</b>: Choline is a fundamental metabolite in plants because of its contribution to the synthesis 
/of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, which accounts for 40 to 60% of lipids in non-plastid plant membranes 
/|CITS: [12215503]|. Choline is also a precursor for the formation of glycine betaine (|FRAME:PWY1F-353|) in certain plants 
/such as spinach, where this osmoprotectant is accumulated and confers also tolerance to salinity, drought, and other
/environmental stresses. In addition choline has been recognized as an essential nutrient for humans |CITS: [11481443]|.
/
/The choline biosynthetic pathway enables plants to decouple choline synthesis from lipid metabolism (Kennedy pathway - 
/|FRAME: TRIGLSYN-PWY|) and provides them with the metabolic flexibility to adapt to environmental conditions where 
/large and variable amounts of choline are beneficial for survival |CITS: [11461929]|.
/
/<b>Pathway information</b>: The first step in choline biosynthesis is the direct decarboxylation of serine to ethanolamine 
/|CITS: [11461929]|, which is catalyzed by a serine decarboxylase unique to plants |CITS: [14634155]|. Ethanolamine is
/widely recognized as the entrance compound to choline biosynthesis. 
/
/The synthesis of choline from ethanolamine may take place at three parallel pathways, where three consecutive N-methylation 
/steps are carried out either on free bases, phospho-bases, or phosphatidyl-bases |CITS: [11481443]|. Although choline 
/biosynthesis accommodates different pathways in plants, most of them share the enzymatic step forming phosphoethanolamine 
/|CITS: [DATKO88A]| |CITS: [DATKO88B]|.  The N-methylation, catalyzed by the phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase 
/(PEAMT), is considered to be the committing step exerting a major control over flux throughout the pathway. It has been 
/demonstrated that the PEAMT of spinach catalyzes all three N-methylations necessary to yield phosphocholine. The 
/confirmed intermediates of this pathway have been determined as monomethyl- and dimethylphosphoethanolamine 
/|CITS: [10799484]|. However, Weretilnyk and coworkers |CITS: [12228655]| argued that the N-methylation of those 
/three steps may be exercised by two different enzymes as they found a different behavior of the enzyme(s) in response 
/to different light settings. 
/
/The pathway displayed (methylation pathway) represents the main biosynthetic route as found in the chenopods family. 
/The N-methylation may also occur species-specific on the free-base level |CITS: [PRUDHOMME92A]|or the phosphatidyl-base 
/level as shown for soybean |CITS: [DATKO88A]|, castor bean |CITS: [TANG97]| and barley |CITS: [HITZ81]|. Consequently, it 
/has been assumed that the reactions embedded in the nucleotide and methylation pathways may be two characteristics
/of one overall phosphoaminoalcohol pathway for the formation of phosphatidylcholine |CITS: [KINNEY93]| in plants.
/
/The further metabolic fate of phosphocholine is also species-specific. Phosphocholine can either be directly dephosphorylated 
/to release choline as observed in spinach |CITS: [12232019]| or incorporated into phosphatidylcholine with the subsequent 
/release of choline, as in tobacco |CITS: [10806254]|. It has also been suggested that the hydrolization of sinapine yielding 
/sinapic acid and cholin (|FRAME:PWY-3301|) may contribute to the content of free choline in plants |CITS: [Strack81]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of choline appears to be regulated by a feedback response of phosphocholine inhibiting its own 
/synthesis by decreasing N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) activities involved in the pathway |CITS: [10799484]|. Pre-growth 
/of carrot and soybean suspension cells as well as <i>Lemna paucicostata</i> in choline enriched culture medium 
/caused a significant decrease of methylated derivatives of phosphoethanolamine |CITS: [MUDD89A]| |CITS: [MUDD89B]|. 
/In contrast, the activity of PEAMT was considerably increased when plants were exposed to salt stress |CITS: [10799484]|
/|CITS: [12232019]|, which is consistent with the high demand for choline as osmoprotectant precursor in such plants.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Anthocyanins are water-soluble, secondary plant products that constitute a major subgroup (about 15 to 20%) of flavonoids |CITS: [Andersen06]|. Almost all vascular plants possess basic anthocyanins such as pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (this pathway) and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (|FRAME:PWY-5125|) responsible for the red to magenta coloration of flowers and fruits and delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (|FRAME:PWY-5153|) introducing blue tones to the floral organs of plants |CITS: [11130659]|.
/
/Anthocyanins play important roles as pigments of flowers and fruits in numerous plants across the plant kingdom to attract insects for pollination and act as protectants against UV-B irradiation |CITS: [14561507]|. They also exhibit anti-oxidant activities and therefore may serve as potential anticancer |CITS: [16084717]| and anti-arteriosclerosis compounds in human health |CITS: [15282635]| |CITS: [12828368]| |CITS: [11960739]|. Anthocyanines constitute biological active metabolites that also modulate inter-species relationships being intimately connected with the co-existence of plants with, e.g. insects, mammals, and birds |CITS: [11820759]|.
/
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As described for the biosynthesis of cyanidin- (see |FRAME:PWY-5125|)  and delphinidin-derived anthocyanins (see |FRAME:PWY-5153|) pelargonidin-based pigments are built up in a series of two enzymes, the anthocyanidin synthase (ANS - synonym leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase - LDOX) converting |FRAME:LEUCOPELARGONIDIN-CMPD| to |FRAME:PELARGONIDIN-CMPD| and the UDPG: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (3-UGT) producing the first stable anthocyanin of this pathway, i.e. |FRAME:PELARGONIDIN-3-GLUCOSIDE-CMPD| |CITS: [Kitamura06]| (for a more comprehensive comment see - |FRAME:PWY-5125|).
/
/The anthocyanidin synthase has been proposed to be a component of a macromolecular complex located at the endoplasmatic reticulum. In dependence on the enzymes involved in the complex (e.g. flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase) and their metabolic order the ANS is involved in the production of pelargonidin-derived pigments as found in strawberry |CITS: [12376640]| and recombinant petunia ANS expressed with 3-UGT in |FRAME:TAX-562| |CITS: [11316805]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/|FRAME:TREHALOSE Trehalose| is a disaccharide widespread among microorganisms and invertebrates |CITS:[4377836]|, where it plays a role in stress protection, particularly with regard to desiccation, freezing, and heat stress |CITS:[CROWE84],[2256682],[9302019]|.  Until recently, it was thought that plants did not produce trehalose.  However, using GC-MS and NMR analysis, trehalose was shown to be produced in <i>Arabidopsis</i> |CITS:[11520870]|.  In fact, an <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant with a T-DNA insertion disrupting <i>AtTPS1</i> is embryo lethal, indicating that trehalose synthesis plays an essential role in plants |CITS:[11851922]|.
/
/The biosynthesis pathway is the same for all species and comprises two steps: the formation of |FRAME:TREHALOSE-6P| from glucose and glucose 6-phosphate by a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and the conversion of this compound into trehalose by a trehalose-phosphatase (TPP).  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, a large number of genes were shown to be structurally related to both TPSs and TPPs |CITS:[11701378]|, however, only a handful have been shown so far to possess those activities |CITS:[11520870]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/
/The two acyclic homoterpenes |FRAME:CPD-8844 (3<i>E</i>)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene| (DMNT) and |FRAME:CPD-8846 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene| (TMTT) are widespread constituents of flower fragrances |CITS:[boland89],[gabler91],[donath95]|.  These homoterpenes are released from the foliage of many plant species following herbivore damage |CITS:[boland92],[dicke94]|.  These compounds are part of the arsenal used in plant tritrophic 'indirect defense', which uses the volatile compounds to attract predators of the herbivores and help them locate their prey so that they do less damage to the host plants |CITS:[Dicke99],[10517823],[16723271]|.
/It has been suggested that |FRAME:CPD-8844 DMNT| might be stored as a &beta;-glucoside of its sesquiterpenoid precursor |FRAME:CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol| and is cleaved by a &beta;-glucosidase contained in the regurgitant of the feeding insect.  |FRAME:CPD-8844 DMNT| would then be generated by an oxidative degradation as exemplified in this pathway.
/Synthesis of sesquiterpenes occurs in the cytosol, however, several studies have shown that the isoprene units of |FRAME:CPD-8844 DMNT| originate both from the cytosolic |FRAME:PWY-922 mevalonate pathway I| and the plastidic |FRAME:NONMEVIPP-PWY methylerythritol phosphate pathway| |CITS:[15796607],[16580034]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The |FRAME: FARNESYL-PP FPP| isoprenoid precursor to this pathway is first acted on by a terpene synthase to form nerolidol. Two different enantiomers may be formed. Different plant species have been observed to contain one or both of these enantiomers (see refs in  |CITS: [DONATH95]|) and plant enzymes that produce both the |FRAME:CPD-8843 R-enantiomer| |CITS: [12481088]| and the |FRAME:CPD-12568 S-enantiomer| |CITS: [10805454][10482672]| have been experimentally identified. 
/
/The next step in the pathway is an oxidative degradation. This was long hypothesized to occur through the activity of a cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, but experimental proof was lacking until an Arabidopsis p450 enzyme, |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1|,  was discovered that can catalyze the formation of |FRAME: CPD-8844 DMNT| from |FRAME: CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol| when expressed in yeast |CITS: [21088219]|. |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| is unlikely to perform this function <i>in planta</i> because |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| does not appear to have a nerolidol synthase. However, several potential orthologs of this enzyme in DMNT-producing species may be good candidates to test for DMNT synthase activty. For example, poplar produces DMNT |CITS: [14756770]| and has a member of the CYP82 family of enzymes, CYP82L2 with 53% amino acid identity to |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1||CITS: [21088219]|. Although |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| acted on the |FRAME:CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol| and a number of other plant species, such as |FRAME: TAX-3884 <i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>| (lima bean), exclusively act on the S-enantiomer, a broad survey of plants revealed that there are examples of species where both enantiomers can be used |CITS: [DONATH95]|. And a direct test revealed that the |FRAME:CPD-8843 R-enantiomer| can be taken up and used by |FRAME: TAX-4577 maize| to produce |FRAME:CPD-8844 DMNT| |CITS: [12481088]|.
/
/Although there is now firm evidence that a cytochrome p450 enzyme can catalyze the formation of |FRAME: CPD-8844 DMNT| the exact mechanism of enzyme action is still being investigated. For instance, it is possible that |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| may promote the direct transformation of |FRAME: CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol|  to |FRAME: CPD-8844 DMNT| with the concomittant release of |FRAME: CPD-8847 but-1-en-3-one| as depicted in this pathway diagram. However, this reaction is labeled a "hypothetical" because this has not been experimentally verified. Interestingly, the formation of |FRAME: CPD-8847 but-1-en-3-one| has not been detected in reactions using an analogous compound |FRAME: CPD-8846 TMTT|  when |FRAME: AT3G25180-MONOMER CYP82G1| is expressed in yeast (see |FRAME: PWY-6668 TMTT biosynthesis|)|CITS: [21088219]|. The authors state that |FRAME: CPD-8847 but-1-en-3-one| may not be detected because of its high chemical reactivity. However, it is also possible that a two-step conversion may occur that includes the formation of intermediate C-13 compound |FRAME: CPD-12901 (<i>E</i>)-geranylacetone|. This compound has been detected to exist in numerous plant species such as apple and |FRAME: TAX-183823 <i>Eucalyptus falcata</i>| |CITS:[20860027][20658674]|. Several researchers have examined this |FRAME: CPD-12568 (3<i>S</i>,6<i>E</i>)-nerolidol|  to |FRAME: CPD-8844 DMNT| chemical conversion in different plants (|CITS: [DONATH95]| and see refs in |CITS: [21088219]|), but further work will be required to clarify the exact manner in which the final step of this pathway is executed.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The glyoxalase system consists of two enzymes, lactoylglutathione lyase (glyoxalase I, EC 4.4.1.5) and hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (glyoxalase II, EC 3.1.2.6) that act coordinately to convert a variety of &alpha;-keto aldehydes into hydroxyacids in the presence of glutathione.  Glyoxalase I, a Zn(II) or Ni(II) metalloprotein, is capable of forming (2-hydroxyacyl)-glutathione from a variety of &alpha;-ketoaldehydes in the presence of glutathione.  These glutathione thiolesters are then hydrolyzed by glyoxalase II to form free hydroxyacids and simultaneously regenerate glutathione.  The glyoxalase system has been found in all organisms studied to date; however, its exact role in the cell has still not been clearly defined. Although glyoxalase I and II can utilize a number of 2-oxoaldehydes, the primary physiological substrate of the glyoxalase system appears to be |FRAME:METHYL-GLYOXAL| (MG), a cytotoxic compound formed primarily as a byproduct of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism |CITS:[2021650],[7213621],[8805566]|.  MG is both mutagenic and cytotoxic: it reacts with DNA to form modified guanylate residues and interstrand crosslinks; MG also reacts with proteins to form glycosylamine derivatives of arginine and lysine and hemithioacetals with cysteines.  Therefore it has been postulated that one of the main roles of the glyoxalase system is the glutathione-based detoxification of MG.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME:ALLANTOIN "Allantoin"| is a common product of purine degradation. Allantoin is rich in nitrogen, and many organisms are able to degrade and recycle it.
/Some bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1458|, |FRAME: TAX-80866| and |FRAME: TAX-264198|, do so under aerobic conditions, while others such as |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: ORG-5985| and |FRAME: TAX-587| do so only anaerobically.
/
/Allantoin degradation is not limited to bacteria. Ureide-transporting plants convert fixed nitrogen in their
/roots to |FRAME:ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|, which are then transported to upper parts
/of the plant, where they are degraded to release the nitrogen. In addition, some fungi and animals also
/degrade allantoin.
/
/The first step of the pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-64|, comprises the hydrolysis of the internal amide bond of |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN|, forming |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| |CITS: [786256]|. This enzyme turned out to be common to all organisms that can degrade allantoin, and is the first step in all allantoin degradation pathways.
/
/|FRAME: ALLANTOATE "Allantoate"| is converted to |FRAME: CPD-1091| via one of two routes. In the first route the nitrogen is liberated in a single step in the form of |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: ALLANTOICASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.4"|), while in the other route it is liberated in the form of |FRAME: AMMONIA| in two steps, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD-598| (starting with |FRAME: ALLANTOATE-DEIMINASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.9"|).
/
/The next step in the pathway is the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX|. Similarly, this conversion can proceed with the liberation of either |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-LYASE-RXN "EC 4.3.2.3"|) or |FRAME: AMMONIA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-HYDROLASE-RXN "EC 3.5.3.19"|).
/
/Several combinations of these routes have been documented. Some organisms possess pathways that produce solely |FRAME: UREA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5694|), some produce only |FRAME: AMMONIA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5692|), and some produce both (see |FRAME: PWY-5705|). In addition, some anaerobic organisms can degrade allantoin to |FRAME: CPD-389| instead of |FRAME: GLYOX| (see |FRAME: PWY0-41|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Complete degradation of |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| to |FRAME: GLYOX| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|, without the production of |FRAME: UREA|, has been demonstrated <i>in vitro</i> with purified proteins from |FRAME: ORG-5993| |CITS: [19935661]|. The reactions occur in the endoplasmic reticulum |CITS: [16661891][20038185]|.
/
/There has been an ongoing debate which route is used by the soy bean plant |FRAME: TAX-3847|. Early reports found that different cultivars were utilizing different routes |CITS:[16664492][16664133][16665292][16666035][10944160]|. 
/Specifically, |CITS: [16666035]| found that the pathway in this organism proceeds without production of |FRAME: UREA|. It should be noted that a later study questioned this statement, suggesting that the previous investigations may have been misled by side effects of the enzyme inhibitor used. That study proposed that both cultivars are utilizing the same degradation pathway, in which the route from |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| to |FRAME: CPD-1091| involves the production of |FRAME: AMMONIA|, while the conversion of |FRAME:CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX| was carried out by EC 4.3.2.3,
/resulting in production of |FRAME: UREA| |CITS: [15020640]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5705|).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/D-Apiose is the only plant cell wall monosaccharide with a branched carbon skeleton.  In higher plant, it is mainly found as a component of the rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII) pectin fraction of the primary cell walls.  In this pectic polysaccharide, D-apiose acts as attachment point for two complex side chains of RGII |CITS:[8798473]|.  The linkage occurs through the formation of a cyclic diester from the hydroxyl groups of the furanose ring of D-apiose with borate, a micronutrient specifically needed by higher plants.  The two remaining hydroxyl groups of the RGII-bound borate diester react with a second D-apiose residue from another RGII chain to form a borate tetraester |CITS:[8798473],[10224062]|.  To date, the pathway leading to the incorporation of D-apiose into this polysaccharide remains largely unknown.  Before incorporation the sugar is however activated in the form of UDP-D-apiose from the decarboxylation of UDP-D-glucuronate (this pathway).  This reaction occurs in a single enzymatic reaction which involves the decarboxylation of the substrate, followed by re-arrangement of the carbon skeleton and ring contraction.  The mechanism of formation of UDP-D-apiose has been proposed in |CITS:[12969423]|.
/
/<b>Enzymatic steps:</b>
/
/The enzyme responsible for the formation of UDP-D-apiose was shown to also catalyze the synthesis of UDP-D-xylose, and is commonly known as UDP-D-glucuronate decarboxylase or UDP-apiose/UDP-xylose synthase |CITS:[12969423]|.  The UDP-apiose/UDP-xylose ratio for the <i>Arabidopsis</i> enzyme was determined to be 0.6.  The same enzyme was  strongly inhibited by UDP-D-galacturonate |CITS:[12969423]|.

COMMENT - <b>General information</b>: A broad variety of volatile ester compounds have been found to constitute components 
/of complex cocktails in numerous plants emitted to serve in both reproductive and vegetative processes.  More 
/than 1.000 low-molecular-weight organic compounds have been identified to date |CITS: [15326281]|, most of 
/them components of floral scents. The flower volatiles function as pollinator attractants but may also be involved 
/in defense mechanism, such as airborne signals to attract natural predators of herbivores |CITS: [12732318]|, to
/directly repel herbivores |CITS: [Gershenzon91]| or to activate defense-related genes in neighboring plants or 
/healthy tissue in infected plants |CITS: [Shulaev97]|. 
/
/Methylbenzoate, methylsalicylate, benzylbenzoate and benzylacetate are found and investigated in floral scents of 
/<i>Clarkia breweri</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Together with cinnamoic esters, terpenoids, fatty acid 
/derivatives, C5-branched compounds, and various nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds |CITS: [15326281]| 
/benzenoid esters form the core of physiologically active volatiles in plants. Certain volatiles such as methylsalicylate 
/and methyl jasmonate (|FRAME:PWY-735|) are also thought to be involved in cell-to-cell signaling |CITS: [Shulaev97]|.
/ 
/
/<b>Special information</b>: The acetyl CoA:acetyl alcohol acetyltransferase (BEAT)  catalyzes the formation of 
/benzylacetate in <i>Clarkia breweri</i> which represents 20 to 40% of the total scent output of this plant. Two 
/other major volatiles benzylbenzoate and methylsalicylate account for 5% each of the scent |CITS: [9489012]|.  
/
/In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the emission of methylsalicylate and methylbenzoate has been observed as a 
/response to biotic and abiotic stress. The enzyme(s) catalyzing those reactions <b>SA</b>MT (salicylic acid 
/methyltransferase) and <b>BA</b>MT (benzoic acid methyltransferase) - together with the <b>TH</b>eobromine 
/synthase termed as <b>SABATH</b> family - represent a structural related group with no significant sequence 
/similarity to other methyltransferases |CITS: [DAURIA03]|. The <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> gene AtBSMT1 and 
/its ortholog in <i>Arabidopsis lyrata</i> (AlBSMT1) can use both substrates (salicylic acid, benzoic acid) but 
/express different substrate affinities |CITS: [14617060]|.
/
/Benzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA):benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT) identified from <i>Clarkia breweri</i> 
/catalyzes the formation of benzylbenzoate (a major volatile) with a broader substrate specificity towards other 
/alcohols and acetyl CoAs. Interestingly, the most similar protein to BEBT found in Arabidopsis does not accept 
/benzoyl CoA but catalyzes the formation of cis-3-hexen-1-yl acetate, another green-leaf volatile using acetyl CoA 
/as substrate |CITS: [12226525]|.

CITATIONS - 14555698:EV-EXP-IDA:3510062665:anuradha
COMMENT - Cell walls of higher plants contain callose, which is a linear homopolysaccharide made up |FRAME: 1-3-beta-D-Glucans a 1,3-&beta;-D-glucan| with &beta;-1,6 branches. Callose plays an important role in many processes associated with plant development and in response to environmental stimuli in the form of abiotic and biotic stresses. Callose is also a transitory component of cell plate involved in the formation of new walls during cell division. It is a structural component of plasmodesmatal canals, and is also found in developing cell walls of fibre cells and cotton seed hairs |CITS: [19410266]|.
/
/The source for the sugar units for callose biosynthesis is |FRAME: UDP-GLUCOSE UDP-D-glucose|, and the main enzyme in callose biosynthesis is callose synthase. The molecular mechanism underlying callose biosynthesis is still poorly understood. Molecular studies have revealed a set of genes in Arabidopsis genome that catalyze and degrade callose |CITS: [19286936]|. 12 glucan synthase like (GSL) genes appear to be involved in male gametogenesis in Arabidopsis |CITS: [18315544]|. Two genes, GSL1 and GSL5, are also known to play a role in pollen development and fertility |CITS: [16021399]|.
/
/Callose is degraded by &beta;-1,3-glucanases |CITS: [11785931]|.

CITATIONS - PMNRXN2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In the early 1990s, two groups working independently discovered a novel subgroup of the inositol phosphate signaling family in which diphosphate groups are added to |FRAME: CPD-1107| and |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE| |CITS: [8440693][8382679]|, forming compounds that are now known as inositol pyrophosphates or diphosphoinositol polyphosphates |CITS: [16429326]|. These molecules have been reported to be involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking |CITS: [12391334]|, transcription |CITS: [12828642]|, chemotaxis |CITS: [13678580]|, telomere maintenance |CITS: [15561716][15665079]|, apoptosis |CITS: [15533939][11337497]|, and DNA repair |CITS: [11851397]|, and to mediate environmental stress responses |CITS:[11956213][15316027][15342793][15936174]|.
/
/The concentration of the molecules appear to be tightly regulated with an extremely rapid turnover |CITS: [19326391]|. By inhibiting the enzymes that remove the pyrophosphate groups (encoded by |FRAME: HS03602|, |FRAME: HS10696|, |FRAME: HS04604| and |FRAME: HS05381|) it was possible to calculate that their cellular pools were normally turning over at least 10 times every 40 min |CITS: [8343137]|.
/
/The pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates has been illucidated. Two main classes of enzymes are involved in yeast and mammals: 5-kinases (encoded in mammals by |FRAME: HS10997|, |FRAME: HS00942| and |FRAME: HS08619|, and in yeast by KcsI) |CITS: [10574768][11502751]| and 1/3 kinases (encoded in mammals by |FRAME: HS09822| and |FRAME: HS07278| and in yeast by Vip1) |CITS:[17412958][18981179]|.
/
/All of these enzymes can phosphorylate |FRAME: MI-HEXAKISPHOSPHATE|, generating either |FRAME: 5-DIPHOSPHO-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-12346P| (in the case of IP6K) or a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-11700| and |FRAME: CPD-11937| (in the case of PPIP5K). These compounds, which contain a single pyrophosphate, are also known simply as 
/InsP7.
/In addition, each enzyme class can continue to phosphorylate the product of the other enzyme class, resulting in a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-11938| and |FRAME: CPD-11939|, also known as InsP8 |CITS: [18981179]|.
/
/Another inositol pyrophosphate that is found in cells is |FRAME: DIPHOSPHO-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-TETRAKISPHOSPH|, whose exact stereomeric structure has not been defined yet. This compound is synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-1107| by the three IP6K |CITS: [10827188 ]|, as well as the |FRAME: HS07712-MONOMER| (|FRAME: HS07712|) |CITS: [11226235]|.

COMMON-NAME - quercetin glycoside biosynthesis (Arabidopsis)
CITATIONS - 16939316:EV-EXP:3615307456:zhang
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Flavonole such as quercetin and its glycosidic derivatives (this pathway) and kaempferol/kaempferol glycoside (compare |FRAME:PWY-5320|) are the major flavonoids found in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [10514319]| |CITS: [16939316]|. Metabolic mutants of Arabidopsis were found to express a different profile of flavonols emphasizing the value of metabolic profiling for the exploration of the underlying pathways |CITS: [Graham98]|. 
/
/The occurrence of the two main flavonols kaempferol and quercetin is predominant in different tissues. Quercetin appears to be the main flavonoid in seeds and kaempferol is more prominent in flowers of Arabidopsis |CITS: [9112784][8528278]|. Beside the glycosylated monomeric flavonols, dimers and oligomers of flavonols have been identified in Arabidopsis which again accumulate in a spatially and temporally controlled manner that is dependent of seed development and maturation of seeds |CITS: [16395586]|.
/
/The biological function of flavonoids including flavonols such as UV-protection, defense and resistance against biological and non-biological agents and interacting with plant hormones |CITS: [11960739]| has been investigated in depth. However, flavonols also have a significant impact on human health as that they are an important component of the daily diet. Flavonols are involved in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular diseases that have attracted researchers to reveal the causal molecular principles |CITS: [16176136][16097445]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Glycosylation is one of the most widespread modifications of plant secondary metabolites that can alter properties and functions of the modified compound. 120 putative UDP-glucose: glycosyltransferases alone have been predicted from the genome of Arabidopsis but for only a few their molecular function has been verified experimentally |CITS: [16214386]|. 
/
/The metabolic steps that generate glycosides of quercetin are catalyzed by enzymes that express broader substrate specificity and usually accept kaempferol and/or isorhamnetin to a comparable degree. In general, flavonols are preferred over flavones and flavanones |CITS: [14697269]| |CITS: [12900416]| matching the flavonoid composition found in Arabidopsis.
/
/The glycosyltransferases acting in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> have been demonstrated to preferentially transport sugars to the 3-OH and 7-OH position of the C and the A-ring of the flavonol, respectively. The enzymes catalyzing the 3-<i>O</i> and 7-<i>O-</i>-glucosylation have been purified from Arabidopsis |CITS: [Kim06]| |CITS: [16794327]| |CITS: [14697269]|. Quercetin and kaempferol-3-rhamnoside are the most abundant flavonols reported and the corresponding enzymes have been purified and characterized via a functional genomic approach just recently |CITS: [12900416]|. The quercetin biosynthesis as displayed reflects the currently known enzymatic steps and the results of metabolic profiling |CITS: [16939316][16395586]| but some of the enzymes catalyzing the formation of e.g. quercetin-3,5-diglucoside remain to be characterized.The identification of the flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnosyltransferase responsible for the formation of major kaempferol and quercetin glycosides in |FRAME:TAX-3701| has been achieved by utilizing transcriptome expression analysis. The molecular function of the flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnosyltransferase (UGT89C1) was confirmed through T-DNA mutants knocked out for the UGT89C1 in which rhamnosylated flavonols could not be found in the metabolic profile. In addition, the recombinant expressed GST-fusion protein demonstrated the very specific 7-rhamnosylation for flavonol mono- and diglucosides |CITS:[17314094]|. The enzymes catalyzing the steps leading to the generation of the precursor compounds |FRAME:CPD-14849| and |FRAME:CPD-14820| have not yet been identified and remain to be shown.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL "<i>myo</i>-Inositol"|-containing phospholipids play an important role in the control of cellular functions within eukaryotic cells, being part of the intracellular signal transductions pathways from various regulators, including hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and serum |CITS: [164246]|. When these regulators interact with their receptors in cell membranes, they induce the hydrolysis of certain |FRAME: Phosphoinositides "phosphoinositides"| to produce second messenger molecules.
/
/A particularly important reaction is the cleavage of |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "1-phosphatidyl-1D-<i>myo</i>-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate"|, which produces two important secondary messaengers.
/One of the cleavage products, |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE|, mobilizes |FRAME: CA+2| ions from intracellular vesicular stores |CITS: [6605482][6146314]| while the other product, |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL "1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol"|, activates |FRAME: HS07962-MONOMER "protein kinase C"| |CITS: [438153][6232463]|, resulting in a variety of biochemical and pharmacological responses. The second messengers derived from inositol phospholipids are crucial for initiation of cellular activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
/
/Variability in the sensitivity of individual receptors to |FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| is a key factor that determines whether transient fluxes of |FRAME: CA+2| release are destined to remain a localized phenomenon, or instead are recruited to produce calcium waves that sweep across the cell.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/|FRAME: L-1-phosphatidyl-inositols "Phosphatidylinositol"| is synthesized from |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL "CDP-diacylglycerol"| and |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| by phosphatidylinositol synthase.
/
/This compound can be phosphorylated by several kinases. In this pathway, it is converted by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase enzymes to |FRAME: CPD-1108 "phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate"|,  which is phosphorylated again by phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases to form |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA  "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"|. Even though it has been shown that |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"| is also synthesized from |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-5-PHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate"| |CITS: [9367159]|, it is generally accepted that the majority of the |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA  "phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate"| in mammalian cells comes from |FRAME: CPD-1108 "phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate"| phosphorylation |CITS: [12897244]|.
/
/
/The last step in this pathway, which is the most important, is catalyzed by phospholipase C enzymes. These enzymes, acting in response to receptor activation, cleave |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA "phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate"| to |FRAME: DIACYLGLYCEROL "1,2-diacylglycerol"| (DAG) and
/|FRAME: INOSITOL-1-4-5-TRISPHOSPHATE| (IP3).
/
/This signal transduction pathway is common to all eukaryotes, and these enzymes are found from yeast to mammals |CITS: [4301226]|. However, while yeast only have one or two isoform for each enzyme, mammals have very many isoforms (not all of which are presented here) that are expressed in different tissues and under different circumstances. The presence of so many isoforms enables the transducton of multiple signals without interference in complex networks of signaling cascades that are not yet well understood |CITS: [18341203]|.
/
/For example, humans have at least four isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, four isoforms of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, and eleven isoforms of phospholipase C enzymes that belong to at least six distinct classes |CITS: [11395409][12117804][17895620]|.

COMMENT - <b>General information:</b>  The phytyl chain is an essential component in the structure of the diverse group of prenyllipids such as chlorophylls, tocopherols and phylloquinone |CITS:[9492312]|.  The phytyl chain allows for the insertion of those compounds into the hydrophobic core of membranes such as the plastid membrane of chloroplasts and etioplasts.  Two date, in the case of the formation of chlorophylls, two pathways of prenylation have been considered: a) the first concerns the prenylation of chlorophyllide a with geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to form geranylgeranyl-chlorophyllide a, this latter being then converted through several successive steps of reduction to form chlorophyll a (see |FRAME:PWY-5064|), and b) the second first converts geranylgeranyl diphosphate to phytyl diphosphate (phyPP, this pathway), this latter compound being prenylated to chlorophyllide a to form chlorophyll a.  The former route was detected in plant etioplasts |CITS:[7408876]|, whilst the second was reported in chloroplasts (where tocopherol |CITS:[7447462]| and phylloquinone |CITS:[7274213]| also appear to be using route of prenylation using preformed phyPP). 
/
/<b>Enzyme information:</b>  In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> a multifunctional enzyme was shown to be able to catalyze the multiple reduction steps in both routes: GGPP to phyPP as well as GG-chlorophyllide a to chlorophyll a |CITS:[9492312]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background:</b>
/
/In addition to be a major constituent of proteins, |FRAME:PRO| also acts as an osmotic protectant in bacteria, plants and 
/animals that are under osmotic stress.  In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, proline can account for up to 20% of the free amino acid pool 
/after salt stress |CITS: [8022935]|.
/
/There are two alternative routes in proline biosynthesis in higher plants: the |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| and the |FRAME:GLT| pathways. It is also known that, as in plants, both ornithine and glutamate are precursors of proline biosynthesis in microorganisms and mammals.  The plant glutamate pathway differs from that in bacteria and human.  In bacteria and human, the conversion of glutamate to glutamate-5-semialdehyde (GSA) is catalyzed by two enzymes via two consecutive reactions, whereas, in higher plants the conversion is catalyzed by a bi-functional enzyme in a single reaction |CITS: [1384052]|.  Many research activities have been devoted to understand the relative contributions of the two alternative pathways to the increased proline accumulations under stress.
/
/Measurement of free proline content and gene expression and enzyme activity levels from salt-stress treated plants |CITS: [9576796]| showed that in young <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants, both the ornithine and the glutamate pathways contribute to the increase of proline 
/level during osmotic stress, whereas, in adult plants, only the glutamate pathway plays an important role in proline accumulation.  The decreased ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and increased pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) transcripts level in salt-stressed moth bean plants suggested that the glutamate pathway is the major contributor in proline accumulation upon osmotic stress |CITS: [8103048]|.  The same study also found that the glutamate pathway is upregulated under nitrogen limitation, whereas, the ornithine 
/pathway is prominent under high nitrogen input. Studies of transcripts level of P5CS and &delta;-OAT and their correlations with the free proline content in Medicago, however, suggested that both the ornithine and the glutamate pathways contribute to the osmotic stress-induced proline accumulation |CITS: [15032841]|.
/
/Abscisic acid (ABA) and salt stress stimulate proline biosynthesis in plants |CITS: [12602867]|. On the other hand, 
/phospholipase D (PLD) was shown a negative regulator of proline biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> |CITS: [14742440]|.
/
/The first reaction catalyzed by P5CS is the rate-limiting step.  P5CS is primarily regulated at the transcriptional 
/level|CITS: [9351242]|.

COMMENT - A significant amount of the fatty acids synthesized in animals by the cytosolic enzyme complex fatty acid synthase (FAS) or taken up by the diet are further elongated into |FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "very long chain fatty acids"| (VLCFAs), which are at least 22 carbons in length. VLCFAs are also important in plants, where they are the main constituents of hydrophobic polymers (such as cuticular waxes, seed oils and membrane sphigolipids) that prevent dessication at the leaf surface and provide stability to pollen grains |CITS: [15277688]|.
/
/VLCFAs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum by sequential addition of C2 moieties from |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| to preformed C18 acyl groups derived from the <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Each elongation cycle is composed of 4 reactions, similar to <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis. The cycle includes the condensation of |FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs| and |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| to form |FRAME: 3-KETOACYL-COA|, reduction to
/|FRAME: 3-HYDROXYACYL-COA|, dehydration to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-COA|, and a final reduction to yield a chain-elongated fatty acyl-CoA |CITS:[16564093]|.
/
/Unlike in <i>de novo</i> fatty acid biosynthesis, |FRAME: MALONYL-COA| rather than |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| is used in the condensing reaction. The elongation cycle is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme complex, the elongase |CITS: [10907783]|, which is composed of four enzymes, |FRAME: AT4G34520-MONOMER| or condensing enzyme |CITS:  [11341960]|, 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, |FRAME: AT5G10480-MONOMER| and |FRAME: AT3G55360-MONOMER| |CITS: [15829606]|.
/
/Substrate and tissue specificity of VLCFAs elongation is determined by the condensing enzyme, which catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are elongated via this pathway. While both NADPH and NADH were shown to be an effective reducing power for the two reduction steps, in many cases NADPH is the 'preferred' reductant (reviewed in |CITS: [8190743]| and |CITS: [16564093]|).

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales, 
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family. 
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many 
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard. 
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, and tryptophan, 
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on 
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different 
/glucosinolates, of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine 
/(range from homomethionine to hexahomomethionine). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among 
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis. 
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

COMMENT - In plants the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, can be broken down. The end 
/products of the catabolic pathways, acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA and acetoacetate, enter the TCA cycle to 
/generate energy. The branched-chain amino acids promote their own degradations, but only during seed 
/germination, senescence, or under sugar starvation. It suggests the degradation pathways provide 
/alternative carbon sources for the plant during severe conditions. In addition, the branched-chain amino 
/acids and their derived alpha-keto acids are cytotoxic. Thus the degradation pathways may be an 
/important detoxification mechanism to prevent their build-up.
/
/Degradation of the three branched-chain amino acids shares the same enzymes for the initial steps.  
/
/All the Arabidopsis enzymes for leucine degradation have been detected in mitochondria |CITS: [14764908]|, 
/suggesting a mitochondrial location of the pathway. A few later step enzymes for isoleucine and valine 
/degradation were not detected in this organelle. Rather, they were found in peroxisomes. It is possible that the 
/degradation of isoleucine and valine spans mitochondria and peroxisomes in Arabidopsis |CITS: [14764908]|. 
/In some other plants including mung bean and sunflower, isolated peroxisomes can convert labeled 
/branched-chain amino acids to propionyl- and acetyl-CoAs. It indicates peroxisomes could be the sole 
/location of branched-chain amino acid degradation pathways in certain species |CITS: [16666252], [16667190]|.

COMMENT - Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is an abundant form of the potent phytohormone auxin. It affects many aspects of plant growth and development and also participates in responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli |CITS: [15749753] [18541211]|. IAA can be conjugated to a number of small molecules, including sugars and amino acids and it can be modified with additional functional groups, including a methyl group. All of these additions, including methylation, can affect the biological activity and biochemical properties of this important hormone |CITS: [15749753]|. 
/
/The biological relevance of methyl IAA (MeIAA) is still under investigation. The addition of a methyl group to IAA converts it from an acid to a nonpolar compound and should enable it to cross membranes more easily. |CITS:[18467465]|. Some experiments suggest that MeIAA is an inactive form of IAA |CITS:[18467465]|. On the other hand, several studies have shown that the exogenous application of MeIAA can cause auxin-like phenotypic changes in plants, and, in some cases, the phenotypes are even stronger than when IAA is applied directly |CITS:[16169896][17926040]|. Therefore, if MeIAA is inactive, this suggests that plants must have adequate levels of MeIAA methylesterase activity to convert exogenously applied MeIAA to IAA. Endogenous MeIAA, like methyl salicylate |CITS:[17916738]|, may be a transport form of the hormone that is moved from its site of production to a site of auxin activity and then transformed into active IAA by methylesterases  |CITS:[18467465]|.
/
/MeIAA is difficult to detect in plants |CITS:[16169896][18467465]|, and this compound only accumulates at very low levels in Arabidopsis |CITS:[18367217]| however it has been observed in a number of plant species (catalogued in <A href="http://kanaya.naist.jp/knapsack_jsp/information.jsp?sname=C_ID&word=C00000101">KNApSAcK</A>). In addition, the phenotypic effects caused by changes the levels of IAMT or MES activity in plants argue that this pathway is important for normal plant growth and development |CITS:[16169896][18467465]|. 
/
/Additional work will be needed to clarify the biological role of MeIAA and to identify the taxonomic distribution of this pathway that can reversibly methylate an important regulator of plant growth, development, and environmental response.
/
/Please note:  Neither MeIAA nor MeIAA methylesterase activity have been experimentally verified in <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> or <i>Picea glauca</i> even though both have active IAA methyltransferases |CITS: [17499822][19369216]| . However, it seems likely that the back reaction occurs. Notably, <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> and other <i>Picea</i> species do have predicted proteins with high similarity to the MeIAA methylesterase from Arabidopsis.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA. The pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP| are incorporated into DNA while the ribonucleoside triphosphates |FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP| are incorporated into RNA. In addition, their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: CPD-12575|, |FRAME: CMP-KDO| and |FRAME: DTDP-D-FUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis of polysaccharides, glycoproteins and phospholipids |CITS: [9576794][12369616][16024685][16669783]|.
/
/In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage pathways reutilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-7193|, |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7199|). The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power, and thus organisms prefer to use salvage pathways when possible. However, the <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are necessary when exogenous precursors are limiting. In order to conserve resources, the <i>de novo</i> pathways are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level.
/These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathway derives in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|. |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, a precursor of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, is derived from oxaloacetate, which is generated in the |FRAME: TCA "TCA cycle"|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts |FRAME: HCO3|, |FRAME: GLN|,
/|FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| and |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) to |FRAME: UMP| (uridine 5'-monophosphate), a pyrimidine nucleotide that can be subsequently converted to all other pyrimidine nucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7176|).
/
/The first enzyme, |FRAME: CARBPSYN-CPLX|, forms |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| which is not only an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis but also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as |FRAME: ARG|, |FRAME: L-CITRULLINE| and |FRAME: CANAVANINE|.
/
/The next step, catalyzed by |FRAME: ASPCARBTRANS-CPLX|, is the condensation of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|
/with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| forming |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| |CITS: [8041358]|, which is cyclized to
/|FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE|, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring. |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE|
/is oxidized to |FRAME: OROTATE| by |FRAME:DIHYDROOROTOX-ENZRXN|. 
/
/The final two steps, the condensation of |FRAME: OROTATE| with PRPP forming |FRAME: OROTIDINE-5-PHOSPHATE|
/(OMP) followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes |FRAME: OROPRIBTRANS-CPLX|
/and |FRAME: OROTPDECARB-CPLX|. The last step is considered the rate-limiting step of the overall
/<i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides |CITS: [7579161]|.
/
/In plants, the two initial enzymatic reactions of this pathway occur in the plastids, while all of the remaining reactions occur in the cytosol and mitochondria |CITS: [22474184]|. This implies that |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| must be exported from the plastids. A plastidic nucleobase transporter specific for uracil (a precursor for pyrimidine salvage pathways) has been reported |CITS: [22474184]|.
/Since the reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: DIHYDROOROTOX-MONOMER "dihydroorotate dehydrogenase"| occurs in the mitochondria, transporters for both |FRAME: DI-H-OROTATE| and |FRAME: OROTATE| must exist, although they have not been identified yet.
/
/The <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides appears to be one of the most ancient biochemical pathways
/as it is evolutionary conserved in all species. Although the enzymatic steps in this pathway are conserved throughout all organisms, some differences in the enzymes do exist. For example, in plants and bacteria the three steps leading from |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| to |FRAME: OROTATE| are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by the single multifunctional |FRAME: CPLX-6703| |CITS: [8619816]|.
/The last two steps of the pathway are carried out by a bi-functional enzyme (|FRAME: AT3G54470-MONOMER|) in plants
/and animals |CITS: [2876681][7579161][9878395]| whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for that purpose.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/GDP-L-galactose is a nucleotide-sugar that is used as biosynthetic precursor of L-galactosyl residues in polysaccharides and oligosaccharides in plants |CITS:[15134748],[14991405],[12954627]|.  The L-galactosyl residues of cell wall polysaccharides, as well as those of glycoproteins only represent relatively minor components of those compounds, which helps explain the relative scarcity of information available concerning their biosynthesis.  Importantly, GDP-L-galactose is also used in |FRAME:PWY-882| in plants.  
/
/<b>Enzymatic steps:</b>
/
/The key enzyme for the conversion of GDP-D-mannose to GDP-L-galactose is the bifunctional GDP-D-mannose 3",5"-epimerase (GME) which catalyzes the reversible, dual epimerization of GDP-D-mannose into both GDP-L-galactose and GDP-L-gulose |CITS:[12954627],[16413588]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major component of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in cell walls of dicotyledon type I and non-graminaceous monocotyledons plants. It also exists in some seeds of trees growing in the tropical zone.
/
/Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. Some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|.
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide XXXG units. The average molecular weight of xyloglucan is more than 50 000  |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of xyloglucan is still not well understood. It is well established that xyloglucan is assembled within Golgi stacks and transported in Golgi-derived vesicles to the cell wall.
/
/The glucan synthase that is involved in xyloglucan synthesis is likely encoded by |FRAME: AT3G28180| gene, characterized from Nasturtium and Arabidopsis |CITS: [17488821]|.
/
/Three xyloglucan 6-xylosyltransferase enzymes that catalyze the transfer of xylose from |FRAME: UDP-D-XYLOSE| onto &beta;(1,4)-linked glucan chains have been reported from |FRAME: TAX-3702| |CITS: [12032363][16982611][18557833]|.  Two of the enzymes (|FRAME: AT3G62720| and |FRAME: AT4G02500|) were shown to preferentially add one xylose to unsubstituted glucans at the second position from the non-reducing end. When using |FRAME: CPD-13238| (GGGGGG), the preferred substrate, the enzymes produced mostly GGXGGG, with GGXXGG also formed after long incubations with a high substrate ratio |CITS: [16982611]|. While the activity of the third enzyme, |FRAME: AT1G74380|, has not been well characterized, it has been shown that a mutant lacking it shows a reduced xyloglucan content |CITS: [18557833]|.
/
/A xyloglucan galactosyltransferase (|FRAME: AT2G20370|) that attaches an &alpha;-L-D-galactose residue specifically to the third xylose residue within the XXXG core structure has been reported from Arabidopsis |CITS: [12837954]|. Other galactosyltransferases may be necessary for galactosylation of other opsitions |CITS: [15020758]|.
/
/Finally, the Arabidopsis |FRAME: AT2G03220-MONOMER| (|FRAME: AT2G03220|) that attaches an &alpha;-L-fucose residue to the third xylose residue within the XXXG core structure has been identified and characterized |CITS: [11854459]|."

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Accept-If-Predicted Pathways, which includes pathways that are present widely throughout the plant kingdom. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>This Pathway in Bacteria:</b>
/
/|FRAME: TAX-83333| can synthesize glutamate from ammonia in two pathways.
/In addition, if complex sources of nitrogen are available, other pathways (see below) become active and
/take over glutamate synthesis. 
/
/The pathway shown here synthesizes |FRAME:GLT| directly from |FRAME: AMMONIA|,
/|FRAME:2-KETOGLUTARATE|, and |FRAME: NADPH|.  
/The other is a cyclic pathway, which consists of two steps and requires ATP, and is described at
/|FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).
/
/Unlike the cyclic pathway, the pathway shown here does not require ATP to drive the reaction.
/The K<sub>m</sub> for ammonia of this reaction is much higher than that of the
/ATP-driven cyclic pathway.
/
/Expression of the two ammonia-to-glutamate pathways is regulated so that they operate under different
/environmental circumstances.  The ATP-independent pathway functions when ammonia is abundant; the
/ATP-driven pathway functions when concentrations of ammonia are low. The ATP-independent pathway
/offers significant energy savings over the ATP-driven pathway, as the latter uses over 10
/percent of the cell's total expenditure of ATP when it is active |CITS: [11807064]|.
/
/If complex sources of nitrogen are available, glutamate can be synthesized from arginine
/(|FRAME: AST-PWY|) or proline (|FRAME: PROUT-PWY|) or from &alpha;-ketoglutarate by
/transamination of the amino group from arginine or aspartate. 
/
/The complexity of glutamate biosynthesis reflects the quantitatively central role that the amino acid plays
/in the metabolism of |FRAME:TAX-562|.  It is a major constituent of <I>E. coli's</I> proteins and because it is
/a major nitrogen donor for other biosyntheses, about 80% of the cell's nitrogen flows through glutamate
/when |FRAME:TAX-562| is growing on a medium containing ammonia as the total source of nitrogen. 
/
/<b>This Pathway in Yeast:</b>
/
/Like |FRAME: TAX-83333 | yeast cells contain 2 pathways for the synthesis of glutamate. 
/One of the pathways, shown here, is mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by
/|FRAME: YOR375C| and |FRAME: YAL062W| |CITS: [2989290][9287019]| (this pathway), while the second
/pathway is driven by the combined activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase,
/encoded by |FRAME: G-9562| and |FRAME: G-9999|, respectively |CITS: [2570348][8923741]|
/(see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|).
/
/Studies of |FRAME: YOR375C| and |FRAME: YAL062W| regulation indicate that the cell uses these
/isoforms under different growth conditions |CITS: [11562373]|.  Expression of GDH3 is induced by ethanol
/and repressed by glucose, whereas GDH1 expression is high in either carbon source.  Gdh1p uses
/&alpha;-ketoglutarate at a higher rate than Gdh3p.
/Thus, under fermentative growth conditions, Gdh1p drives glutamate biosynthesis, whereas in
/nonfermentable or limiting carbon sources, Gdh3p is the key isoform involved in balancing distribution of
/&alpha;-ketoglutarate to glutamate biosynthesis and energy metabolism.

COMMENT - In most plants, the primary products of fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) are 
/16:0-ACP and 18:0-ACP. Delta9 18:0-ACP desaturase is ubiquitous to plants. It introduces the first 
/double bond to 18:0-ACP. Additional double bonds are inserted to oleate and palmitate after they are 
/incorporated into lipids (|FRAME: PWY-782|, |FRAME: PWY-762|). 
/
/Unusual acyl-ACP desaturases, insert double bonds in a position other than the delta9 position of 
/18:0-ACP. Unusual fatty acids are mostly found in seed storage lipids.

COMMENT - The production of |FRAME: GLUTAMINYL-TRNA-GLN| can occur in two different ways.  In Gram-negative bacteria and
/in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, there are separate tRNA synthetases for charging |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs| with
/|FRAME: GLN| and |FRAME: GLT-tRNAs| with |FRAME: GLT| (see |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|).  However,
/Gram-positive bacteria (such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|), archaea and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells lack a synthetase for
/charging |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs| with |FRAME: GLN| (although in some protists and fungi, it is imported from
/the cytosol into mitochondria).  This results in a misacylation of |FRAME: GLN-tRNAs| with |FRAME: GLT| by a
/nondiscriminating |FRAME: MONOMER-13959|.  A second enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX-7606|, is used to transamidate
/the misacylated |FRAME: L-glutamyl-tRNAGln| to |FRAME: GLUTAMINYL-TRNA-GLN|.  In
/|CITS: [9342321]| and in |CITS: [18441100]|).

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b> cytokinins have profound physiological roles in plants, <i>e.g.</i> promotion of cell division, release of lateral buds from apical dominance, and delay of senescence. The biological activity of cytokinins have long been studied. However, the uncertainty persists as to how different classes of cytokinins play different roles in plant development. The main form of cytokinin in plant cytoplasmic prenylated-tRNAs is <i>cis</i>-zeatin |CITS:[TALLER94]|. Although <i>cis</i>-zeatins can sometimes be found in plants in the tRNA-free form |CITS:[12228609]|, and even be the predominant form of cytokinins in the species <i>Cicer arietinum</i> |CITS:[9701607]|, the physiological relevance of <i>cis</i>-hydroxylated cytokinins remains unclear. Indeed, in plants, it has been shown that <i>cis</i>-cytokinins have only low activity. The most biologically-relevant cytokinins have a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated <i>N<sup>6</sup></i> side-chain. With the uncovered existence of a zeatin <i>cis-trans</i> isomerase |CITS:[12231873]| came the postulate that <i>cis</i>-type cytokinins could contribute to the synthesis of <i>trans</i>-type cytokinins. This possibility is however thought to be improbable |CITS:[14726522]|. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> the <i>trans</i>-type cytokinins are synthesized in plastids from DMAPP precursors originating from the plastidic methylerythritol (MEP) pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-2681|), conversely the <i>cis</i>-type cytokinins are synthesized through prenylation of tRNA molecules in the cytosol using DMAPP precursors originating from the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway.
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b> so far only one enzyme has been characterized for the tRNA-dependent cytokinin biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The tRNA isopentenyltransferase activity of the enzyme encoded by <i>IPT2</i> was demonstrated by heterologous expression of the gene in yeast |CITS:[11999372]|. To date no enzyme able to catalyze the stereo-specific hydroxylation of the isoprene side chain has been found and it is not known whether this hydroxylation step occurs after pentenylation of the tRNA adenine using DMAPP as a substrate or whether an hydroxylated analogue of DMAPP could give <i>cis</i>-zeatin-tRNA directly |CITS:[11999372]|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/<b>General Background</b>
/
/Polyamines, organic molecules with multiple amino groups, are critical for proper regulation of the cell cycle, and are synthesized in large amounts in rapidly growing cells. During polyamine synthesis |FRAME: MET| is consumed through the utilization of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), in a reaction that releases |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) (see the pathway |FRAME:BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY| for an example).
/MTA is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration is tightly regulated. This control is achieved through the |FRAME: PWY-4361| pathway, where MTA is recycled through a series of reactions that convert its 5-methylthio-D-ribose moiety to |FRAME: MET|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The |FRAME: PWY-4361 "methionine salvage"| pathway is found in a wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protozoa, plants and mammals. It has been partially characterized for a number of organisms, including rat |CITS: [7852397][7068632][7007366]|, plants, yeast |CITS: [3906034]|, bacteria and protozal parasites |CITS: [8585735][ 11443076]|. The best characterized pathway is from the Gram-negative bacterium |FRAME: TAX-573| |CITS:[8694776][11371200][9880484][7852397][8227039]|.
/
/However, the initial steps of the methionine salvage pathway, between |FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA) and |FRAME: CPD-1063| (MTRP), are different between microorganisms (such as the bacteria |FRAME: TAX-573| |CITS: [8694776]| and |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [12022921]|), protozoa (such as |FRAME: TAX-5741| and |FRAME: TAX-5833| |CITS: [2854458]|) and mammalian cells.
/This pathway shows the methionine salvage pathway utilized by most bacteria. 
/
/In all cases, MTRP is subsequently recycled to |FRAME: MET| by the same route. This metabolic differences in the first step of the pathway are being exploited for developing new drugs targeted against pathogenic microorganisms that utilize the MTA nucleosidase-MTR kinase pathway |CITS: [2854458][2153115][1929327]|.
/
/MTRP is coverted to |FRAME: CPD-8999| by the extraction of a water molecule, and the later is converted
/to |FRAME:CPD-85| by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-7445|, which at least in some strains, such as
/|FRAME: TAX-1423|, is a member of the RubisCO protein family |CITS: [17352497]|.
/
/|FRAME:CPD-85| can be oxidized to |FRAME:CPD-479| (KMTB) non-enzymatically in the presence of
/air |CITS: [7852397]|. However, in the cell this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme
/|FRAME: MONOMER-1323| |CITS: [11371200][9880484]|. It is yet unknown whether the non-enzymatic
/reaction occurs in vivo |CITS: [7852397]|.
/|FRAME:CPD-85| can also be oxidized to |FRAME:FORMATE| and |FRAME:CPD-7672|, which is a
/shunt of the methionine salvage pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5389|) |CITS: [11371200][9880484]
/[7852397]|. Interestingly, the two reactions are catalyzed by enzymes that share a common polypeptide
/sequence and differ only in the metal ion present. The Fe-ARD enzyme catalyzes the conversion
/to |FRAME:CPD-479|, while the Ni-ARD enzyme produces |FRAME:CPD-7672| |CITS: [12022880]|.
/The purpose of this off-pathway reaction is yet unknown; it may, however, provide a
/mechanism for regulating |FRAME: MET| levels <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [11371200]|.
/
/<b>This Pathway in Plants:</b>
/
/In plants, this is part of the |FRAME: PWY-7270 methionine recycling pathway| known as the MTA or Yang Cycle |CITS:[miyazaki87][21540433]|.
/While studying the production of ethylene in apple fruit tissue, Baur and Yang |CITS:[baur72]| noted that,
/although methionine was in quantities sufficient for the production of ethylene only for a few hours,
/ethylene was being produced for months.  Since no volatile sulfur was detected, it was postulated that
/it was recycled to replenish the methionine pool. It was later shown that the methylthio group of MTA
/was recycled to methionine via 5'-methylthioribose (MTR) and 5'-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P)
/|CITS:[murr75],[adams77]|.  It was initially thought that this methylthio group was transferred to
/a four carbon acceptor molecule such as homoserine to regenerate methionine.  Later studies
/however showed that in plants, like in yeast cells, rat liver and bacterial extracts, the ribose moiety
/of MTA was also incorporated into the 2-aminobutyrate moiety of methionine.  In animals, MTA is also
/recycled to methionine but not through the production of MTR. Instead, MTA is phosphorolytically
/cleaved by MTA phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.28) to yield MTR-1-P.  Although the participation of
/&alpha;-keto-&gamma;-methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) as an intermediate in the Yang Cycle has been
/demonstrated in avocado extracts, little is known of the exact nature of the intermediates involved in
/the rest of the cycle |CITS:[kushad83]|. The conversion of KMB to methionine appears to
/occur rapidly as KMB does not seem to accumulate in plants |CITS:[miyazaki87]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes. 
/In plants, polyamines have been involved in senescence and morphogenesis |CITS:[11537482]|.  Their specific molecular functions <i>in vivo</i> are however not yet fully understood. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.
/
/|FRAME:SPERMIDINE| is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed spermidine synthase.  The propylamine group is transferred from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which is produced by the action of the pyruvoyl-containing enzyme adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.  The other product of the aminopropyltransferase reaction is |FRAME:5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE| (MTA), which is recycled back to |FRAME: MET|.

/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/Phytosterols are ancient molecules in plants; they are part of the cell membrane architectural components. The specific structural feature of phytosterols are the 24-alkyl group in the sterol side chain |CITS: [11111078 ]|. This has evolved into more complex forms from single cellular organisms to vascular plants. Fungi, algae and protozoa, synthesize 24&beta;- methyl sterols or ergosterols, plants synthesize 24 &alpha;- ethyl sterols like sitosterols. Alkyl steroids have immense variation in the structures in nature and only small fractions of them have been identified |CITS: [19818974]|. 
/
/The sterol methylations are catalyzed by (S)-adenosyl-L-methionine: &Delta;(24)-sterol methyl transferase (SMT) which are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of plant sterols. Non-photosynthetic organisms do not have these enzymes. Several fungi and plant SMT's have been cloned and extensively characterized |CITS: [9208946]|. The transformation of olefins into structurally variable C-methylated products by SMT's are complex and under investigations for over 50 years. Although SMT's from lower organisms and plants appear to be distinct their mechanistic behavior and mode of sterol transformation appears to be similar |CITS: [12946407]|. 
/
/In this pathway, the SMT isoforms SMT2-1 and SMT2-2 show differential expression in distinct developmental stages, such as flowering and seed development, where SMT2-2 levels during seed development are higher than SMT2-1 and SMT1. This indicates the genes of the SMT's have undergone divergent evolution. The authors of this study hypothesize that the primitive SMT gene to have been bifunctional and catalytically promiscuous |CITS: [19818974]|.
/
/This pathway describes the reaction of sterol 24C methyltransferases (SMT2-1, SMT2-2) from |FRAME:TAX-3847| with the mechanism-inactivator of SMT's |FRAME:CPD-12159|. This inhibitor has been used to determine SMT concentrations in soluble fractions and has also been applied as binding and enrichment factor for SMTs in purification procedures of various organisms |CITS:[12196515] [19818974]|. SMT2 enzymes are thought to be key enzymes in diverting the carbon flux from C24 methyl sterols (campesterol) towards the C24 ethyl sterols (sitosterol) formation (see |FRAME:PWY-2541|) |CITS:[20865301]|. The latter are very important molecules for the food industry due to the cholesterol lowering properties of phytosterols such as |FRAME:CPD-4143| |CITS:[9630383]|. In this pathway SMT2-1 and SMT2-2 react with the mechanism-based inhibitor |FRAME:CPD-12159| which either binds the SMT enzymes covalently and forms |FRAME:CPD-12160| and |FRAME:CPD-12162| when treated with methanol and/or potassium hydroxide or is converted into enzyme-free |FRAME:CPD-12161| which can enter the sterol pathway |CITS: [19818974]|.

COMMENT - In plants the branched-chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine, can be broken down. The end 
/products of the catabolic pathways, acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA and acetoacetate, enter the TCA cycle to 
/generate energy. The branched-chain amino acids promote their own degradations, but only during seed 
/germination, senescence, or under sugar starvation. It suggests the degradation pathways provide 
/alternative carbon sources for the plant during severe conditions. In addition, the branched-chain amino 
/acids and their derived alpha-keto acids are cytotoxic. Thus the degradation pathways may be an 
/important detoxification mechanism to prevent their build-up.
/
/Degradation of the three branched-chain amino acids shares the same enzymes for the initial steps.  
/
/All the Arabidopsis enzymes for leucine degradation have been detected in mitochondria |CITS: [14764908]|, 
/suggesting a mitochondrial location of the pathway. A few later step enzymes for isoleucine and valine 
/degradation were not detected in this organelle. Rather, they were found in peroxisomes. It is possible that the 
/degradation of isoleucine and valine spans mitochondria and peroxisomes in Arabidopsis |CITS: [14764908]|. 
/In some other plants including mung bean and sunflower, isolated peroxisomes can convert labeled 
/branched-chain amino acids to propionyl- and acetyl-CoAs. It indicates peroxisomes could be the sole 
/location of branched-chain amino acid degradation pathways in certain species |CITS: [16666252], [16667190]|.

COMMENT - Phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids, and are ubiquitous in all organisms. In plants, at least four 
/types of phospholipases have been reported including phospholipase A1 (PLA1), phospholipase 
/A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C (PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD). PLAs are directly implicated in the removal of 
/unusual fatty acids from phospholipids for their integration into triacylglycerol. PLAs are also involved in plant signal 
/transduction, such as responding to auxin stimulation of growth, pathogen and elicitor (reviewed in|CITS: [15130548]|). 
/PLCs hydrolyze phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and 
/diacylglycerol, and are thus important in secondary messenger pathways|CITS: [11377433]|. Broad 
/physiological activities have been postulated for PLDs, including plant responses to abscisic acid, 
/ethylene, wounding, pathogen elicitation, seed germination, water loss, and nodulation|CITS: [11706190]|.
/
/
/PLA1 and PLA2 specifically hydrolyze the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl ester bond of phospholipids, respectively.  
/In addition to PLA, phospholipase B (PLB) sequentially removes both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl groups of 
/phospholipids.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Galacturonate (GalA) is a major sugar residue of plant pectic polysaccharides |CITS:[MOHNEN02]| and a minor component of some plant arabinogalactan proteins (Darvill et al., 1980; Yates et al., 1996).  GalA is also found in various cell-surface polysaccharides of different Gram negative bacteria (for review see |CITS:[15563616]|).  The existence of GalA is not restricted to Gram-negative bacteria being present in the capsular polysaccharide of the Gram-positive human pathogen type-I <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, as well as in certain polysaccharides
/of the <i>Cyanobacterium</i> spp..  The synthesis of GalA-containing polymers requires UDP-&alpha;-D-galacturonate (UDP-GalA).
/
/The formation of UDP-D-GalA occurs via two routes: a) a salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-D-GalA from free galacturonate (this pathway), and b) a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route involving the epimerisation of UDP-D-glucuronate by a UDP-D-glucuronate 4-epimerase (|FRAME:PWY-4861|).  
/
/In plants, the primary role of the sugar salvage pathways is presumed to be in the recycling of sugars derived from the turnover of macromolecules such as polysaccharides, galactolipids and proteoglycans, which have sugar components. 
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>
/
/The galacturonokinase and UDP-D-galacturonate pyrophosphorylase activities characterizing this pathway have been found in plants from extracts of <i>Phaseolus aureus</i>; unfortunately, further enzymatic characterization is not available at this time.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Plants must confront many different dangerous xenobiotic compounds in their environments. Often, plant enzymes modify these compounds to change their reactivity and/or subcellular localization in order to render them less toxic |CITS: [20626660]|. Glycosylation, glutathione conjugation, sulfonylation, and other modifications have been observed in many plant species and their role in detoxification has been compared to xenobiotic modifications that take place in the liver |CITS: [7894495]|. Sometimes, multiple modifications may be introduced sequentially, such as the glycosylation followed by malonylation depicted in this pathway |CITS: [6303788][1832837][20626660][11598135]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Naphthols are phenolic xenobiotic compounds that may be encountered in the soil by plants. Studies on tobacco cultured cells indicate that naphthols are harmful. Not surprisingly, tobacco, as well as several other plant species, including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, and <i>Oryza sativa</i> (rice) modify naphthols forming compounds such as |FRAME: CPD-13685 2-naphthol 6'-O-malonylglucoside| |CITS:[TAGUCHI03][15860007 ][20626660]|. 
/
/In this pathway, glucosyl moieties are first introduced by glucosyltransferases. When plants are grown in liquid media, glucosylated naphthols are excreted into the solution by some plant species, including Arabidopsis and tobacco |CITS: [20626660]|. However, malonyltransferases, such as two enzymes identified in Arabidopsis (|FRAME: AT5G39050-MONOMER PMaT1| and |FRAME: AT3G29670-MONOMER PMaT2|) and one in tobacco can further modify the glucosylated naphthols to produce malonylated glucosides . In contrast to the glucosides, these doubly modified compounds appear to be retained within plants, presumably within the vacuole |CITS: [20626660]|. The compounds present in this pathway represent a subset of the products that can be formed by |FRAME: AT5G39050-MONOMER PMaT1| and |FRAME: AT3G29670-MONOMER PMaT2| <i>in vitro</i>. Further work will be required to understand the biologically relevant substrates of these enzymes and to gain a better understanding of how both glycosylation and subsequent malonylation of compounds contribute to plant defense against both xenobiotics and endogenously produced harmful compounds |CITS: [20626660]|.

COMMENT - In plants, the pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine is first deaminated by cytidine deaminase to uridine |CITS: [10024464],[10469156]|. Uridine, also a pyrimidine nucleoside, is hydrolyzed by uridine nucleosidase to free the pyrimidine base uracil by removal of the sugar ribose group |CITS: [19293370]|. Both uracil and uridine can be scavenged to pyrimidine nucleotide via a salvage pathway. Alternatively, uracil can be further degraded to beta-alanine by releasing NH3 and CO2 in a three step reductive pathway (|FRAME: PWY-3982 uracil degradation II (reductive)|). Beta-alanine is a precursor of pentothenate and coenzyme A.  
/
/In contrast, in E. coli and mammals, uridine is converted by uridine phosphorylase to the free uracil base and a phosphorylated ribose (|FRAME: PWY0-1295 pyrimidine ribonucleosides degradation I|).

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>:
/
/Phylloquinone (vitamin K1, 2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) acts as the electron 
/transfer cofactor A1 of photosystem I (PS I) in higher plants and cyanobacteria. In microbial organisms a very similar 
/compound menaquinone (|FRAME:MENAQUINONESYN-PWY|) plays an essential role in several anaerobic electron 
/transport systems |CITS: [8626063]|. The chemical structure of menaquinone (vitamin K2)  exhibits a partly unsaturated 
/predominantly C-40 side chain whereas phylloquinone consists of a mostly saturated, C-20 phytyl side chain |CITS: [15686525]|.
/
/The biosynthesis of phylloquinone was studied in detail in the cyanobacteria <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and 
/the genes encoding enzymes of this pathway were identified by comparison with genes encoding enzymes of the 
/menaquinone biosynthetic pathway in <i>Escherichia coli</i> |CITS: [8626063]|. With the isolation and functional confirmation 
/of the homolog genes in <i>Synechocystis</i> encoding for phytyl transferase, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate synthase 
/|CITS: [10722690]|, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyltransferase |CITS: [11772039]|, SHCHC synthase and 
/o-succinylbenzoic acid-CoA synthase |CITS: [JOHNSON03]| most of the enzymatic steps of the phylloquinone bisoynthesis 
/have been determined and proven to be highly identical with those in the menaquinone biosynthesis.
/
/The biosynthesis of certain components of the multienzyme complex PS I of cyanobacteria and plants such as phylloquinone 
/have been found to follow analogous routes including corresponding enzymatic activities |CITS: [HEIDE82]| |CITS: [KOLKMANN87]|
/|CITS: [SIMANTIRAS89]| |CITS: [SIMANTIRAS91]| which reflects the function and phylogenetic origin of PS I in 
/photosynthetic species.  
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>:
/
/The enzymatic steps involved in the biosynthesis of phylloquinone in cyanobacteria and 
/plants are almost identical to the biosynthetic route leading to the microbial complement menaquinone. However, it has 
/been demonstrated in cell suspensions of <i>Galium mollugo</i> that the formation of the key intermediate 
/1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphtoate (DHNA) preferably occurs via 4-(2'-carboxyphenyl)-4-oxobutyryl CoA. The 
/o-succinylbenzoate CoA ligase catalyzes the attachment of the CoA to the C1 of the side chain of o-succinylbenzoate 
/(OSB), creating the "aliphatic" variant of o-succinylbenzoate-CoA |CITS: [SIMANTIRAS91]| instead of forming the 
/"aromatic" isomer where the CoA ester is attached to the aromatic carboxyl group. 
/
/The following reaction, the prenylation of DHNA is the discernible step between phylloquinone and menaquinone biosynthesis. 
/The DHNA phytyltransferase catalyzes the attachment of a C-20 phytyl side chain leading to |FRAME:CPD-6947| 
/|CITS: [15686525]|, whereas the microbial DHNA octaprenyltransferase attaches a C-40 side chain forming |FRAME:DEMETHYLMENAQUINONE|. 
/
/It has been found that phylloquinone is not absolutely required for efficient electron transfer in PS I |CITS: [10722690]|. 
/In <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 benzoquinones such as plastoquinone-9, usually acting as secondary electron 
/acceptor in PS II |CITS: [11470786]| |CITS: [15681848]| can efficiently replace phylloquinone in the A1-site of PS I as 
/a one-electron cofactor. However, as shown in an <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant the deficiency of phylloquinone causes 
/distortions in the thylakoid structure of chloroplasts, may abolish PS I and affects the functionality of PS II |CITS: [15686525]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID &alpha;-linolenate| (often refferred to as simply linolenate) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) that is
/an important constituent of plant membranes. It is also known as an &omega;-3 fatty acid, referring to
/the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid.
/Seed oils are the richest sources of |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID &alpha;-linolenate|, especially those of rapeseed (canola),
/soybeans, walnuts, flaxseed (Linseed), perilla, chia and hemp.
/It is also common in the lipids that are found in thylakoid membranes in the green leaves of broadleaf
/plants, and in cyanobacteria and alga |CITS:[4621688][414660]|.
/|FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID &alpha;-linolenate| is an essential fatty acid for animals, and is considered an essential dietary
/requirement for all mammals.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In all plant tissues, the major glycerolipids are first synthesized using only palmityl (16:0) and oleoyl
/(18:1) acyl groups, the products of the plastidic saturated fatty acid synthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-5971 palmitate biosynthesis II (bacteria and plants)|,
/|FRAME: PWY-5989 stearate biosynthesis II (bacteria and plants)| and |FRAME: PWY-5147 oleate biosynthesis I (plants)|). Subsequent desaturation of the fatty acids to the highly
/unsaturated forms typical of the membranes of plant cells is carried while they are already attached to
/lipids.
/
/Most of the oleoyl-[acp] is released from the [acp]-moiety and exported from the plastid to the
/endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is converted to |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA oleoyl-CoA| in the process by the
/plastidic |FRAME: AT1G77590-MONOMER acyl-CoA synthetase|. The |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA oleoyl-CoA| is incorporated into lipids,
/forming |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE a 1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol-3-phosphate|, |FRAME: Diacylglycerides a diacylglycerol|, and
/|FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE a phosphatidylcholine|.
/Further desaturation of the oleoyl groups to linoleoyl groups in the ER occurrs while incorporated
/into lipids. The first step, which produces |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups a lipid linoleoyl group|, is catalyzed by the
/|FRAME: CPLX-1903 fatty acyl &Delta;<sup>15</sup> desaturase (endoplasmic reticulum)|, encoded by the |FRAME: AT3G12120 FAD2| gene. The second step, which produces
/|FRAME: Alpha-linolenoyl-groups a lipid &alpha;-linolenoyl group|, is catalyzed by the |FRAME: AT2G29980 FAD3|-encoded
/|FRAME: CPLX-1903 fatty acyl &Delta;<sup>15</sup> desaturase (endoplasmic reticulum)|.
/

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The sulfonation of biological compounds (sulfoconjugation) is a fundamental metabolic process,
/in which a sulfate group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond.
/The sulfonation of biomolecules occurs widely and results in a dramatic change in the
/physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds |CITS: [Huxtable86]|.
/Sulfonated macromolecules such as |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans|, |FRAME: HEPARIN|
/or |FRAME:Glucosinolates| are involved in many important processes, such as cell adhesion,
/hemostasis, the viscoelastic properties of connective tissue, and plant defense mechanisms.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor
/molecule |CITS: [13851709]|. In many organisms, including plants and mammals, |FRAME: PAPS|
/(PAPS) is used as the universal sulfonate donor for all sulfotransferase reactions  |CITS: [13575436][6107250]|. 
/It should be mentioned that in plants most of the APS is used for biosynthesis of |FRAME: CYS| and
/|FRAME: MET| via the further reduction of APS to sulfide (see |FRAME:SULFMETII-PWY|).
/In mammals, however, all of the APS is converted to PAPS and used for sulfonation.
/
/For an extensive list of sulfonation reactions using |FRAME:PAPS|, please look at that compound's

COMMENT - Phosphatidylcholine is one of the major constituents of membrane phospholipids (see |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN2-PWY|). 
/The phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathways vary among different organisms. 
/
/There are at least four alternative routes have been reported in plants. Two additional routes were 
/reported in animals|CITS: [438165]| and bacteria|CITS: [10858449]|.
/
/1) The Kennedy pathway (|FRAME: PWY3O-450|) depends on choline kinase and on the availability of choline. 
/
/2) The second pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-2|) depends on three consecutive N-methylation steps that are 
/carried out on phospho-bases, phosphoethanolamine, phospho-N-methylethanolamine, and 
/phospho-N-dimethylethanolamine. 
/
/3) The third pathway (depicted here) depends on an initial N-methylation with phospho-base 
/phosphoethanolamine, and followed by two downstream N-methylations on phosphatidyl-bases, 
/phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine. In plants, 
/phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine is believed to be derived from CDP-methylethanolamine, 
/whereas in animals, it is a direct methylation product from phosphatidylethanolamine|CITS: [438165]|. 
/
/4) The forth pathway (|FRAME: PWY4FS-4|) depends on two N-methylations with phospho-base 
/phosphoethanolamine and phospho-N-methylethanolamine, followed by a downstream 
/N-methylation on phosphatidyl-base phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine.
/
/Radio tracer experiments with crude cell extracts suggested such a pathway in soybean and carrot |CITS: [16666464]|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are 1-thio-beta-D-glucosides. They are found prominently in the order Capparales, which 
/includes cabbage, mustard, oilseed rape, broccoli, and the model plant Arabidopsis. In addition to be 
/responsible for the typical sharp taste and odor of many glucosinolate-producing plants, glucosinolates 
/play an important role in plant defense. In plant herbivore defense, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed and 
/broken down to toxic compounds by the myrosinase system. Myrosinases are S-glycosidases. They are 
/the only known S-glycosidases. Isothiocynate, automatically formed from the myrosinase product 
/thiohydroximate-O-sulfate, is bioactive. It has been shown to have antimicrobial and insecticidal 
/activities. In the presence of an epithiospecifier protein (ESP), thiohydroximate-O-sulfate is 
/converted to bioactive nitrile or epithionitrile depends on the structure of the glucosinolate|CITS: [11752388]|. 
/For alkenyl glucosinolates possessing a terminal alkene group, epithionitriles are formed, whereas 
/simple nitriles are formed for other glucosinolates. In the absence of ESP, as in some Capparales 
/species, isothiocynates are the only breakdown products|CITS: [11752388]|. Glucosinolates and 
/myrosinases are stored in different compartments. Only upon tissue damage, such as feeding by 
/herbivores, the two systems are brought into contact resulting in glucosinolate breakdown.

COMMENT - The pathway in plants is essentially the same as those operating in
/microorganisms. There are a few noteworthy differences between the plant
/enzymes and the microbial enzymes: 1) the second and the third step are
/catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme in plants; 2) the fifth step, conversion of BBM
/III to IGP and AICAR, requires two catalytic functions, including a transfer of an amide from
/glutamine followed by a cyclization reaction. In prokaryotes, these two
/catalytic activities are encoded by two genes whose proteins form a
/complex. In yeast and plants, this conversion is catalyzed by a
/bifunctional enzyme; 3) like the yeast enzyme but unlike the E. coli
/enzyme, the plant imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydrogenase is a
/monofunctional enzyme lacking the histidinol phosphatase activity. In
/all organisms operating the pathway, the enzyme catalyzing the first
/step is feedback-inhibited by L-his. In plants, the entire pathway is
/located inside the chloroplast. Plant histidine biosynthesis has been recently reviewed in |CITS: [16547652]|.
/
/The overall level of histidine present in Arabidopsis plants seems to be controlled by the activity of the first enzyme in the pathway because overexpression of either |FRAME: AT1G58080| or |FRAME:AT1G09795| increases the total free histidine content measured in the rosette leaves of Arabidopsis plants. Meanwhile, overexpression of seven downstream genes in the pathway fails to increase the histidine levels |CITS: [19486323]|.

COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: PRO| can be catabolized to |FRAME: GLT| by the action of two enzymatic activities: |FRAME: EC-1.5.99.8| (PDH) (sometimes referred to as proline oxidase) and |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.88| (previously known as &Delta;-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, or P5CDH).
/
/Whereas in eukaryotes PDH and P5CDH are encoded by two different genes, in most bacteria, including enteric bacteria
/|CITS: [6270100][6270101]|, |FRAME: TAX-1061| |CITS: [7592417]|, |FRAME: TAX-375| |CITS: [8572700]|, |FRAME: TAX-658| |CITS: [8645272]|, |FRAME: TAX-358| |CITS: [8971722]|, and |FRAME: ORG-6005| |CITS: [10715000]|, both steps are catalyzed by a single polypeptide encoded by the <i>putA</i> gene. The enzyme is highly conserved among different microorganisms, but its genetic organization and control of expression are highly divergent |CITS: [10715000]|.
/
/|FRAME:TAX-4932| is able to utilize proline as a sole nitrogen source. |FRAME: PRO| is catabolized within the mitochondrial matrix. Since both enzymes are encoded in the nucleus and synthesized in the cytoplasm, they are imported into the mitochondria before they become active |CITS:  [387737] [6358862]|.
/
/|FRAME: PRO| can serve as a total source of carbon and energy or of nitrogen for |FRAME:TAX-562|.  In the two steps (both of which are catalyzed by a product of <i>putA</i>) shown here, proline is converted to |FRAME: GLT|, which is further degraded to |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|, an intermediate of the |FRAME: TCA|.  Curiously, |FRAME: GLT|, the product of |FRAME: PRO| degradation, cannot itself serve as a total source of carbon and energy for |FRAME:TAX-562| because |FRAME: GLT| transport supplies exogenous |FRAME: GLT| at an inadequate rate. 
/
/The pathway is shown here in three steps because |FRAME: L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE| is an intermediate between |FRAME: L-DELTA1-PYRROLINE_5-CARBOXYLATE| and |FRAME: GLT|. The hydrolysis of |FRAME: L-DELTA1-PYRROLINE_5-CARBOXYLATE| to |FRAME: L-GLUTAMATE_GAMMA-SEMIALDEHYDE| occurs spontaneously.
/
/In addition to serving as a building block of proteins, |FRAME: PRO| acts as an osmotic protectant.  Consistent with this role, high osmolarity inhibits |FRAME: PRO| degradation.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>
/
/Plastoquinone is an electron carrier of the photosynthetic electron transport chain.  Plastoquinone exists in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, and acts as an electron carrier between Photosystem II and the cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>-f complex in the photosynthetic electron transfer reaction.  It is also a cofactor involved in the desaturation of |FRAME:PHYTOENE| in the synthesis of carotenoid, a photosynthetic pigment (see |FRAME: CAROTENOID-PWY|). Most plants possess nine or 10 units of the isoprenoid side chain of plastoquinone and ubiquinone: in <i>Arabidopsis</i> the number of subunits is nine (|FRAME:PLASTOQUINONE-9|).  The committed step in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis is condensation of |FRAME:HOMOGENTISATE| (providing the aromatic head) and |FRAME: SOLANESYL-PYROPHOSPHATE| (providing the hydrophobic prenyl tail).  An analogue reaction is found in the |FRAME:PWY-1422| pathway.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: CPD-110 "Salicylic acid"| (salicylate; SA) is an aromatic compound commonly found throughout the plant kingdom that is also found in some bacteria.
/
/In plants |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| affects numerous biological and physiological processes, including plant defense (via the systematic acquired resistance system |CITS: [15283665][12873532]|), allelopathy, flowering, and stomatal movement |CITS: [SCHULZ93]|. Given its important signaling role, plants often chemically modify |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| by attaching glycosyl, methyl, or other groups to |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| to alters its activity, volatility, or other properties |CITS [PIERPOINT94][SCHULZ93]|. In particular, |FRAME: CPD-12628 salicylate 2-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| (SAG) is believed to be more water-soluble than |FRAME: CPD-110 SA|, thus enabling it enter the vacuole more easily via an ABC transporter or a H<sup>+</sup>-antiporter |CITS: [15032822][15871031]|. This process may serve to prevent plants from being over-exposed to active SA and/or may enable the storage of this important signaling compound |CITS: [18248508]|. Notably, in some species, enzymes that perform this glucosylation are up-regulated as levels of |FRAME: CPD-110 SA| rise |CITS: [SCHULZ93]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/A number of plant species have been shown to catalyze the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12628 SAG|, such as |FRAME: TAX-4097 <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>| (tobacco) |CITS: [15871031]|, |FRAME: TAX-3689 <i>Populus</i>| (poplar) species and hybrids, |CITS: [20177744][17599371]|, |FRAME:TAX-3708 <i>Brassica napus</i>| |CITS: [19449088]|, and |FRAME: TAX-4530 <i>Oryza sativa</i>| (rice) |CITS: [12228500]|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12628 SAG| may be further modified to produce additional salicylate glucosides that differ between species. For example,  |FRAME:CPD-12663 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate 2-O-&beta;-D-glucoside| is made by |FRAME: ORG-5993 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> col| (see |FRAME: PWY-6621 salicylate glucosides biosynthesis I|) |CITS: [18248508]|.

COMMENT - The biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), an important methyl donor, is from methionine. The 
/condensation of methionine and ATP results in a positively charged and thus active sulfonium ion in SAM, and 
/consequently the bounded methyl group can be easily transferred to methyl acceptors.

COMMENT - <b>General information</b>: Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are vital cofactors 
/for enzymes mediating one-carbon-transfer reactions |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [10785666]|. Folates are involved in a 
/wide range of key metabolic functions including the biosynthesis of methionine, purines, thymidylate and panthotenate. 
/In plants folates are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis 
/|CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [12644692]|. The fluxes through C1 pathways mediated by folates are especially high for 
/methylated compounds such as the secondary metabolites lignin, alkaloids and betaines and for primary metabolites 
/such as choline, pectine and chlorophyll |CITS: [11337394]|.
/
/Although the biosynthetic steps in microbial folate biosynthesis essentially mirror the plant variant several differences
/are noteworthy. In contrast to the bacteria pathway (|FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) which predominantly takes place in the
/cytosol, the plant variant of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis is split between three subcellular compartments |CITS: [11960743]|. 
/Several plant enzymes involved in the tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis differ from their microbial counterparts with regard
/to functionality, regulation and composition |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [14745019]| |CITS: [15500462]|. Plants prefer the 
/polyglutamylated forms of folates (compare |FRAME:PWY-2161|, |FRAME: PWY-2161B-PMN|) since the turnover rate of those 
/compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [SCOTT00]| |CITS: [KIRK94]|and meets the high demands for 
/folates as observed in plants |CITS: [11960743]|. In addition the conjugated forms of folate facilitate the retention 
/of the vitamin within the cell and its subcellular compartments |CITS: [1916088]|.
/
/Bacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize folates <i>de novo</i>, but humans are unable to synthesize folate and need a 
/dietary supply. Lack of folate is the most serious vitamin deficiency decease for humans and results in reduced DNA 
/synthesis and cell division rate. Folates are, to a varying degree, all unstable, due to the oxidative cleavage into pteridine 
/and pPABA glutamate maoities which is additionally promoted by light. The high demand for folate in fundamental metabolic 
/processes and their chemical susceptibility to oxygen and light may be part of the difficulties to prevent folate deficiency 
/even in highly developed countries and has aroused intensive research to genetically engineer the folate biosynthetic 
/pathway |CITS:[SCOTT00]|. 
/
/<b>Special information</b>:  Folates are tripartite molecules and are made up of pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pABA) and 
/glutamate moieties. In plants the pterin moiety is formed from GTP in the cytosol, which couples to pABA (synthesized 
/in plastids) in mitochondria followed by subsequent glutamylation and reduction steps which may take place in cytosol,
/mitochondria and plastids |CITS: [11960743]| |CITS: [11752472]|. The one-carbon units are either attached to the 
/N-5 of the pterin moiety, to the N-10 of the pAPA moiety or are brigded in between those two (e.g. 5,10-methenyl 
/or methylene-THF) |CITS: [BASSET05]|.
/
/Increased efforts in research to unravel the plant folate biosynthesis have recently resulted in the cloning of the missing 
/plant enzymes - aminodeoxychorismate synthase (ADCS) |CITS: [14745019]|, aminodeoxychorismate lyase (ADC lyase) 
/|CITS: [15500462]| and dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHN aldolase) |CITS: [15107504]| |CITS: [15165863]|completing the 
/enzymatic steps in folate biosynthesis.
/
/In the pABA branch a reaction unique to plants has been identified, which reversibly converts pABA to its glucose 
/ester by a cytosolic glucosyltransferase. It has been shown that most of the pAPA in plants exists as glucose ester.
/Although the physiological function of this reaction remains to be elucidated the glucose ester was proposed to be 
/involved in storage and transportation processes of pAPA |CITS: [12668665]|.
/
/The complete set of folate enzymes is only present in mitochondria. However, the recent discovery that folylpolyglutamate 
/synthases are present in cytosol, mitochondria and plastids with each of them encoded by a different gene in <i>Arabidopsis 
/thaliana</i> |CITS: [11752472]| points to the fact that at least parts of the pathway can be carried out independently in 
/those compartments. Interestingly, the enzyme hydrolyzing the polyglutamylated folates (&gamma;-glutamyl hydrolase) 
/has been found to be an extracellular enzyme in plants |CITS: [8912628]|. Consequently, the transport and exact conversion 
/of folates and their derivatives within the different cell compartments and their regulation pattern remains to be clarified 
/before successfully attempting the endeavor to genetically engineer this pathway.

COMMENT - Jasmonates are an important class of compounds, related to |FRAME:CPD-734|, found throughout the plant kingdom
/as well as in fungi |CITS:[17513307]|).
/These compounds may participate in a number of biological processes including resistance to herbivores and some
/pathogens, protection against ozone, senescence, and reproductive development (reviewed in |CITS:[19025383][17513307]|). 
/
/Many different jasmonate precursors and jasmonate derivatives have biological activity, including jasmonyl
/(JA)-amino acid conjugates. Different species may have a different array of JA-amino acid conjugates, and the
/biological activity of each compound may differ between species. For example, jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has
/been shown to have biological activity in a number of different plants, including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
/|CITS:[15258265][18247047]|, <i>Nicotiana attenuata</i>|CITS:[17273867][17085687]|, <i>Achyranthes bidentata</i>
/|CITS:[18812165]|, barley |CITS:[9315685]|, tomato |CITS:[18458331]|, rice |CITS:[ 9013895]| and others.
/In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, JA-Ile promotes the interaction between COI1 (an F-box) protein and the
/JAZ1 repressor protein. In this manner, JA-Ile is believed
/to help destabilize the JAZ1 repressor and thereby promote JA-responsive transcription |CITS:[17637677]|.
/COI1 and JAZ homologs have been found in other plants, such as tomato, where they also bind in a JA-Ile-dependent
/manner, |CITS:[18458331]|, indicating that JA-Ile might have a similar function in other plant species.
/
/However, in  <i>Polygonum longisetum</i>, a weed commonly found in Japan, a treatment of 100 uM JA-Ile fails
/to stimulate the normal JA-responsive emissions of volatile sesquiterpenes |CITS:[TAMOGAMI07]|.
/Other differences in biological activity have been observed across species for many other conjugates including
/JA-ACC, JA-leucine, and JA-valine. 
/
/Additional studies suggest that the specific isomeric forms of the same jasmonate can have very different biological effects.
/For example, initial studies suggested that (-)-JA-Ile was a biologically active phytohormone |CITS: [SEMBDER93][17291501]|. However,
/later work shows that |FRAME: CPD-11259| is the biologically active form of the compound |CITS: [19349968
/]|. This compound exists at low levels in most commercial preparations of |FRAME: CPD-11232| and may explain the observed
/biologically activity originally associated with the (-)-JA-Ile diastereomer. A pure preparation of (-)-JA-Ile does
/does not promote JAZ/COI1 binding <i>in vitro</i> |CITS: [19349968]|. Interestingly, the biologically
/active form, |FRAME: CPD-11259|,
/more closely resembles the potent bacterial phytotoxin coronatine than |FRAME: CPD-11232| does |CITS: [19349968][19377448]|.
/
/In Arabidopsis, no biological function has been identified yet for JA-Leu, JA-Val, JA-Phe, JA-ACC even
/though there is evidence that all of these compounds exist in this plant |CITS:[15258265]|. It is unclear whether these
/are storage forms of JA or catabolic intermediates.
/Another important
/phytohormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), can be conjugated with several amino acids, as shown in the
/|FRAME:PWY-6219| pathway. Some of these compounds, such as IAA-aspartate are targeted for further
/breakdown (|CITS:[9733548]|, (see |FRAME:PWY-2021|), while others, such as, IAA-alanine may serve
/as storage forms. A family of amido hydrolases can release free, active IAA from some of these
/"storage" IAA conjugates |CITS:[7792259][10072397]|. But, to date, no JA-amido hydrolases (that could release free
/JA from the amino acid conjugates) have been identified in plants. However, this enzymatic activity has been
/detected in the fungus, <i>Botryodiplodia theobromae</i> |CITS:[9141491]|.
/Further work will be required to determine the metabolic and functional fate of the "inactive" JA-amino acid
/conjugates identified in Arabidopsis.
/
/<i> In vitro</i>, JAR1 can catalyze the addition of many different amino acids to jasmonate |CITS: [15258265]
/[17291501][18247047]|, but in a <i>jar1</i> mutant background, only the levels of IAA-Ile are reduced suggesting that other
/enzymes must be responsible for the production of other JA-amino acid conjugates in Arabidopsis thaliana |CITS: [15258265]|.

COMMENT - <b>General background</b>: Folates act as carriers of one-carbon units in bacterial, mammalian and plant tissues and have been found central to the biosynthesis of various elemental compounds, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides |CITS: [11337394]|.
/
/Polyglutamylation of folates up to seven glutamates appears to be crucial since the turnover rate of those compounds is markedly increased |CITS: [9190084]| |CITS: [SCOTT00]| |CITS: [KIRK94]| and meets the high demands for folates as observed in plants |CITS: [11960743]|. 
/The turnover of polyglutamylated folates is realized in various pathways (see |FRAME: PWY-2161B-PMN|) ensuring the recycling and interconversion of those at high costs produced metabolites . 
/The broad variety of folates biosynthesized in |FRAME:PWY-3742| or  |FRAME:PWY-3841| form the substrates for the polyglutamylation (this pathway) and the pathway transforming the various folate species (see |FRAME:PWY-2201|).
/
/<b>About the pathway</b>: Polyglutamylation probably takes place after the reduction step of dihydrofoalate to tetrahydrofolate inclusive the subsequent conversion of related derivatives. The addition of glutamate residues to folate occurs via &gamma;-carboxy-links that represent a specific bond which cannot be cleaved by peptidases or proteases specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds and require the catalytic specificity of |FRAME:CPLXQT-30|.
/
/The serine hydroxymethyltransferase converts 5,10-methylene-THF to tetrahydrofolate |CITS: [OGREN84]|  and possesses also a second catalytic activity converting 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate to 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate in the presence of glycine |CITS: [2201683]| |CITS: [1536856]|. In the next reaction(s) folylpolyglutamate synthase catalyzes the stepwise formation of polyglutamates from various folates |CITS: [11752472]| which range from terahydrofolate polyglutamates over N<sup>10</sup>formyl-tetrahydrofolates to 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolates. 
/
/The intermediary step of the reversible formation of N<sup>10</sup>formyl-tetrahydrofolate from tetrahydrofolate is carried out by formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase (syn. 10-formyl-THF synthetase) which has been demonstrated to possess a monofunctional activity in plants in contrast to the trifunctional complex in other eucaryotes |CITS: [1644815]| |CITS: [12668769]| |CITS:[Kirk94]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b> Pyrimidines can be catabolized through three different pathways. The best characterized is
/the reductive pathway (this pathway and thymine degradation(reductive)) in which pyrimidines are reduced to&beta;-amino acids,
/|FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|. The pathway is found in mammals, microorganisms and plants
/|CITS:[13428755][13416173][traut96]|. The oxidative pathway is only found in a few bacterial
/species and has not been characterized nearly as well. In it uracil is converted to |FRAME: UREA| and |FRAME: MALONATE|
/via |FRAME: BARBITURATE| |CITS: [12981104][14955523]|. A third pathway has recently been discovered
/in E. coli and other bacteria, but has not been characterized yet |CITS: [16540542]|.
/
/&beta;-alanine is a central component of |FRAME:PANTOTHENATE| and
/|FRAME:GAMMA-BUTYROBETAINE| biosynthesis. In bacteria the synthesis of &beta;-alanine occurs through the
/decarboxylation of L-aspartate. This route of biosynthesis however appears to be unique to prokaryotes and absent
/ in eukaryotes. In several plants species as well as mammals &beta;-alanine was shown to be derived from the degradation
/ of uracil |CITS:[mazus72],[duhaze03],[traut96]|. Radiotracer experiments in germinating grains of <i>Triticum sativum</i>
/ and whole plants of <i>Limonium latifolium</i> showed that uracil can be efficiently converted to the &beta;-alanine.
/
/Experiments in Arabidopsis plants indicate that pyrimidine degradation may play an important role in re-allocating nitrogen
/stored in pyrimidines to general nitrogen metabolism pathways under conditions of low nitrogen |CITS: [19413687]|.
/
/<b>In AraCyc:</b>
/
/In |FRAME: ORG-5993|, at least three different enzymes have been linked to this pathway based on mutant phenotypes.
/Mutant plants (<i>pyd1</i>, <i>pyd2</i>, and <i>pyd3</i>) have increased levels of uracil and decreased release of labeled
/CO<sub>2</sub> from C<sup>14</sup>-labeled uracil |CITS: [19413687]|. Furthermore, <i>pyd2</i> and <i>pyd3</i> mutants cannot survive on uracil
/as their sole nitrogen source indicating that these two enzymes are required for uracil catabolism. <i>pyd1</i> mutants can
/survive on uracil and have a higher fraction of labeled uracil metabolized than the other two mutants suggesting that another
/may catalyze the first reaction in the pathway or that an alternative route of uracil degradation that still includes the second and
/and third reactions shown in this pathway |CITS: [19413687]|.
/
/Transcripts of all three Arabidopsis genes associated with this pathway (PYD1, 2, and 3), are up-regulated by growth under low
/nitrogen conditions or in the presence of high levels of uracil |CITS: [19413687]|. 
/
/Currently, very little is known about the sub-cellular compartmentation of this pathway. But, the finding that PYD1 localizes
/to the plastid, PYD2 to the
/secretory system, and PYD3 to the cytosol indicates that this degradation pathway may be associated with more than
/one organelle |CITS: [19413687]| and that various intermediates may need to be transported during the catabolic process.

COMMENT - Linoleate is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is abundant in many vegetable oils, especially safflower and sunflower 
/oils. It is an essential dietary requirement for all mammals that lack the delta12 desaturase that produces it. 
/
/In all plant tissues, the major glycerolipids are first synthesized using only palmityl (16:0) and oleoyl (18:1) acyl 
/groups. Subsequent desaturation of the fatty acids to the highly unsaturated forms typical of the membranes of 
/plant cells is carried while they are already attached to lipids (see |FRAME: PWY-762|, |FRAME: PWY-782|). 
/
/As depicted here, oleoyl-[acp] is first released from the [acp]-moiety and then converted to oleoyl-CoA.  
/Leoyl-CoA is incorporated into lipids and is further desaturated to linoleoyl groups.

COMMENT - The three aromatic amino acids, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, derived from the common precursor 
/chorismate, are not only constituents of proteins but also precursors of many secondary metabolites found in plants. 
/There are two possible routes to synthesize tyrosine from the intermediate prephenate: via 
/arogenate by the activity of prephenate aminotransferase or via p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate by the activity of 
/prephenate dehydrogenase. The p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate route has been confirmed in many microorganisms including E.coli 
/and yeast. However, compiling evidence suggests that many plants employ the arogenate route. The alternative 
/p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate route cannot be completely ruled out for plants based on the facts: 
/1) early studies detected prephenate dehydrogenase activity in mung bean shoots|CITS: [4379953]|, 2) the Arabidopsis arogenate dehydrogenase TyrAAT2 presents a weak prephenate dehydrogenase 
/activity|CITS: [12354106]|, even though the high Km for prephenate and low specific activity of prephenate 
/dehydrogenase reaction indicates the reaction is unlikely physiologically significant. The two alternative routes 
/have been reported co-exist in many other microorganisms.
/
/Arogenate is the branch-point and the immediate precursor for the synthesis of both tyrosine and phenylalanine. 
/Arogenate dehydrogenase is the key enzyme channeling arogenate towards tyrosine synthesis. Its activity is 
/strongly feedback inhibited by tyrosine. The Arabidopsis arogenate dehydrogenase is strictly NADP-dependent, 
/whereas the maize enzyme is strictly NAD-dependent|CITS: [12354106][Byng1981]|.

CITATIONS - 15632054
CITATIONS - 15632054:EV-EXP:3343673520:tissier
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/
/Chlorophyll is a green photosynthetic pigment found in photosynthetic plants, algae, and bacteria.
/Its name is derived from ancient Greek: <i>chloros</i> = green and <i>phyllon</i> = leaf.
/Chlorophyll absorbs mostly in the blue and, to a lesser extent, red portions of the electromagnetic
/spectrum, hence its intense green color. There are several variants of chlorophyll (for example, see
/|FRAME:PWY-5068| for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-B| and |FRAME:PWY-5526| for
/the biosynthesis of |FRAME:CPD-9067 |). This pathway describes the formation of
/|FRAME:CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|, an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of all chlorophylls.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The biosynthetic pathway of chlorophylls begins with the condensation of eight molecules of
/|FRAME:5-AMINO-LEVULINATE| (ALA, originating from |FRAME: GLT|) to
/|FRAME:UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III|, the first cyclic tetrapyrrole (see |FRAME: PWY-5188|).
/This compound is then sequentially converted to |FRAME:PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|, which is the
/branch-point intermediate to hemes and chlorophylls.
/The incorporation of |FRAME: MG+2| into |FRAME:PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX| occurs at the
/next step, resulting in the formation of |FRAME:MG-PROTOPORPHYRIN| (MgP).
/A methyl transferase subsequently converts MgP into
/|FRAME:MG-PROTOPORPHYRIN-MONOMETHYL-ESTER| (MgPMME), which is the substrate for a
/cyclase reaction, involving molecular oxygen.
/The cyclase forms |FRAME:DIVINYL-PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|, an intermediate that contains a
/fifth ring (ring E), characteristic of all chlorophylls.
/Finally, a combined action by |FRAME:MONOMER-11752| and |FRAME:AT1G03630-MONOMER|
/results in the light-dependent formation of |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLLIDE-A|.
/
/This biosynthetic pathway, which occurs in all aerobic photosynthetic organisms, has been described
/through genetic analysis of bacterial mutants and <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution of individual reactions
/|CITS:[9442890][12242396][beale99][14617630]|.
/
/Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria possess a very similar pathway. However, the cyclase found in these
/organisms does not require molecular oxygen. A variant of the pathway found in anaerobic bacteria
/is described in |FRAME:PWY-5531|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/|FRAME: 5-METHYLTHIOADENOSINE <i>S</i>-methyl-5'-thioadenosine| (MTA) is a side product in the biosynthesis of several important compounds.
/An important case is polyamine synthesis, where |FRAME: MET L-methionine| is consumed through the utilization of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine| (SAM) in a reaction that releases MTA (see the pathway |FRAME:POLYAMINSYN3-PWY superpathway of polyamine biosynthesis II|). MTA is a strong inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions, and its concentration needs to be tightly regulated.
/
/Another example is found in the pathogen |FRAME: TAX-287 <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>|, where MTA is a by product in the synthesis of the autoinducer compounds |FRAME: CPD-10783 PAI-1| and |FRAME: CPD-10784 PAI-2| (see |FRAME: PWY-6157 autoinducer AI-1 biosynthesis|).
/
/To ensure that the pathways that produce MTA as a byproduct are not blocked, the organism must remove this compound. The most common way of achieving it is through the |FRAME: PWY-4361 "methionine salvage"| pathway, in which MTA is recycled through a series of reactions back to AMP and |FRAME: MET L-methionine|.
/While the methionine salvage pathway is widely conserved, its initial steps, converting MTA to |FRAME:CPD-444 <i>S</i>-methyl-5-thio-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-phosphate|, differ among microorganisms and plants (such as the bacteria |FRAME: TAX-573 <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>| |CITS: [8694776]| and |FRAME: TAX-1423 <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>| |CITS: [12022921]|), protozoans (such as |FRAME: TAX-5741 <i>Giardia intestinalis</i>| and |FRAME: TAX-5833 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>| |CITS: [2854458]|) and mammalian cells. The different routes employed by these organisms are described in the different pathways under |FRAME: Methylthioadenosine-Degradation <i>S</i>-methyl-5'-thioadenosine Degradation|.

COMMENT - The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A), which is present in all eukaryotic cells, must be activated by post translational modification before it can participate in the initiation of protein synthesis. 
/The modification involves the addition of a |FRAME: BUTYLAMINE| residue (derived from |FRAME: SPERMIDINE|) to a highly 
/conserved lysine in the eIF-5A protein |CITS: [11278418]|. This results in the formation of an unusual amino acid called |FRAME: CPD-9974|. The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9974| occurs exclusively within the eIF-5A precursor, and is catalyzed by two enzymatic steps, |FRAME: MONOMER-13914| (DHS) and |FRAME: HS05318-MONOMER| (DOHH) |CITS: [10542236]|. 
/
/The biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9974| is found in all eukaryotes and the DHS and DOHH enzymes are highly 
/conserved, indicating that the fundamental cellular function of elF5A is maintained from plants to mammals. 
/DHS enzymes have been isolated and characterized from several animals and plants. The second enzyme (DOHH) has been charaterized from mammals, and homologs were identified in the |FRAME: TAX-3701| and |FRAME: TAX-4527| genomes.
/
/In tomato there is an increase in the abundance of DHS mRNA as well as elf5A mRNA in senescing flowers and fruits and in environmentally stressed leaves, suggesting that this enzyme plays a role in programmed cell death |CITS: [11278418]|. The antisense suppression of deoxyhypusine synthase in tomato dealys fruit softening and alters growth and development |CITS: [15951486]|.
/
/The strict substrate specificity for hypusine modification provides possible drug targeting of these enzymes, particularly in aberrant cell proliferation |CITS: [17476569]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates is divided into three major stages, 
/first the chain elongation of amino acids such as methionine (this pathway) and phenylalanine, followed by the 
/core biosynthesis of the glucosinolates (compare |FRAME:PWY-1187 glucosinolate biosynthesis from homomethionine|) and finally secondary modifications of 
/the glucosinolates |CITS: [12049923]| |CITS: [16669764]|. 
/
/The structural diversity of glucosinolates results from different precursor amino acids, varying length of the 
/side chain and different patterns of secondary oxidation and esterification |CITS: [TOKUHISA04]|. Over 
/120 different glucosinolates have been described so far in plants |CITS: [11198818]|. Glucosinolates belong 
/to one of the largest group of secondary metabolites found in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 
/|CITS: [15860428]|, where 39 glucosinolates have been identified in 34 different ecotypes indicating the 
/plasticity of glucosinolate biosynthesis. A significant part of that diversity of aliphatic glucosinolates in 
/Arabidopsis is based on varying side chain length |CITS: [11402209]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The reaction sequence that is characteristic for the side chain elongation of 
/methionine comprises three steps. Those reactions form a cycle which is repeatedly run through for the production of the C3 to C8 glucosinolates (the number of C refers to the number of methylene groups in the side chain) found in Arabidopsis |CITS: [17369439]|. The first step is the condensation of acetyl-CoA with the deaminated 2-oxo-derivative of methionine, followed by the isomerization of the generated 2-malate derivative to form a 3-malate derivative which finally undergoes oxidative decarboxylation yielding a 2-oxo acid that is elongated by one more methylene group and can either reenter the cycle or proceed to the core biosynthetic steps |CITS: [16669764]|.
/
/This side chain elongation cycle very much resembles the reaction sequence being found in |FRAME:LEUSYN-PWY leucine biosynthesis|. Therefore it was not surprising that enzymes of leucine biosynthesis also function in methionine chain elongation leading to glucosinolate biosynthesis, and vise versa |CITS: [18162591], [19597944], [19674406]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Information:</b>  Thousands of nonsteroidal triterpenes have been identified and, in spite of their elusive functions, the ubiquity of these compounds among higher plants implies that they are essential.  Lupeol is a pentacyclic triterpene present in plants but not fungi and animals.  Lupeol displays anti-inflammatory properties when administered to rats, yet, unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, had no antinociceptive, anti-pyretic and ulcerogenic actions  |CITS:[11378285]|.  Lupeol was also reported to be involved in apoptosis |CITS:[14719056]|.
/
/<b>Key Notes on the Enzymes:</b>  Lupeol is synthesized by oxidosqualene cyclases from oxidosqualene.  These enzymes catalyze the cyclization, rearrangement and deprotonation of oxidosqualene to simultaneously form a variety of triterpene compounds in varying amounts.  The first lupeol synthase identified from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was thus shown to catalyze the formation of -not only- lupeol but |FRAME:CPD-6951|, |FRAME:CPD-6948|, |FRAME:GERMANICOL|, |FRAME:CPD-6949| and |FRAME:CPD-6950| |CITS:[10930257]|.

COMMENT - Several types of cytokinins conjugation exist which render cytokinins inactive. When plants are subjected to high levels of cytokinin application, the major conjugate that forms is the 7-<i>N</i>-glucoside |CITS: [15342621]|. In contrast to the <i>O</i>-glucosides, the 7-<i>N</i>- and 9-<i>N</i>-glucosides are resistant to glucosidases |CITS: [8235622]|, and this feature, together with their accimilation in the plant, has led to the suggestion that N-glucosylation is involved in detoxification |CITS: [15342621]|.

COMMON-NAME - glycerophosphodiester degradation
CITATIONS - PMNRXN2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME:TAX-562| K12 possesses two systems the salvage of |FRAME: Glycerophosphodiesters "glycerophosphoryl diesters"|, the Glp system and the Ugp system. 
/
/In the Glp system, the |FRAME: EG10399| gene encodes a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (periplasmic GDP) which hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to an alcohol and |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|. The latter is then transported into the cell by the GlpT transporter. Periplasmic GDP is specific for the glycerophospho- moiety of the substrate, while the alcohol can be any one of several alcohols. This provides the cell with the capability of channeling a wide variety of glycerophosphodiesters into the <i>glpQT</i>-encoded dissimilatory system.
/
/In the Ugp system the diesters are hydrolyzed during transport at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| and an alcohol by a cytoplasmic GDP, an enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: EG11050| gene. The Ugp system is induced when the cells are starved for inorganic phospate, which is  generates phosphate by the system |CITS: [1851953]|.
/
/In |FRAME:TAX-562| |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| can be further metabolized to |FRAME: DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| by either of two membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic |FRAME: AERGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| (encoded by the |FRAME: EG10394| gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|. Under anaerobic conditions, a different |FRAME: ANGLYC3PDEHYDROG-CPLX "glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase"| is preferentially expressed. This tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the <i>glpACB</i> operon, channels the electrons from |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P| to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|.

CITATIONS - 16445886:EV-EXP:3547323793:dreher
COMMENT - Sterols are ubiquitous components of eukaryotes that play a key role in controlling fluidity and flexibility of
/their cell membranes. |FRAME: LANOSTEROL| is a tetracyclic triterpenoid, which is the compound from which all sterols are derived.
/
/Lanosterol is found in vertebrates and fungi, where it is an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol and
/ergosterol, respectively.
/In addition, lanosterol has been found in several prokaryotes, including the |FRAME: TAX-29| species |FRAME: TAX-41|
/|CITS: [12519197]| and |FRAME: TAX-54| |CITS: [Kohl83]|, |FRAME: TAX-114| |CITS: [14660793]|, and
/|FRAME: TAX-51353| |CITS: [10802170]|.
/
/The enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| to |FRAME: LANOSTEROL| is
/|FRAME: HS08480-MONOMER|, also known as 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase.
/The polycyclization cascade of |FRAME: EPOXYSQUALENE| is one of the most complicated
/biochemical reactions catalyzed by a single protein. It leads to the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds with
/accurate regio- and stereochemical specificities |CITS: [12120044][16351060]|.
/
/A prokaryotic enzyme has recently been cloned from |FRAME: TAX-414| and expressed in |FRAME: TAX-562|,
/confirming activity |CITS: [17928701]|. The enzymatic reaction proceeded in a regio- and stereospecific fashion identical
/to those from eukaryotic species, implying that the bacterial gene may have been acquired from ancient
/eukaryotes (along with the gene encoding |FRAME: MONOMER-14485|) through lateral gene transfer |CITS: [17928701]|.

COMMENT - Glucosinolates are nitrogen and sulfur containing secondary metabolites found mainly in the order Capparales, 
/which includes crop plants such as oilseed rape, and the model plant Arabidopsis of the Brassicaceae family. 
/Glucosinolates play an important role in plant defense. They also give the typical sharp taste and odor to many 
/members of the Brassicaceae family such as mustard.
/
/Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids including methionine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan 
/and are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates, respectively. Most of our knowledge on 
/glucosinolate metabolism came from studies in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis accumulates over 30 different glucosinolates, 
/of which the majority are aliphatic glucosinolates derived from chain elongated methionine (range from homomethionine 
/to hexahomomethionine) (compare |FRAME:PWYQT-4450 aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, side chain elongation cycle|). The profile of these glucosinolates varies a lot among 
/Arabidopsis ecotypes, a result of allelic variation of the genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis.
/
/The conversion of aldoxime to thiohydroximate in glucosinolate biosynthesis involves the incorporation of reduced sulfur. Cysteine was previously suggested to be the sulfur-donor. Recent evidence indicates, however, glutathione is more likely to be the sulfur-donating molecule |CITS: [19483696]|.

UNIQUE-ID - METHIONINE-DEG1-PWY
TYPES - METHIONINE-DEG
COMMON-NAME - methionine degradation I (to homocysteine)
CITATIONS - PMNUPP2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: This pathway is on the list of Ubiquitous Plant Pathways, which includes pathways that are thought to be present in all or most land plants. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/In the degradation pathway shown here, |FRAME: MET| is first metabolized to|FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (SAM), a compound that mediates most biological methylations. In the second reaction, the <i>S</i>-methyl group is transferred to other acceptors in a transmethylation step. The product, |FRAME: ADENOSYL-HOMO-CYS|, is then hydrolyzed to |FRAME: HOMO-CYS| and |FRAME: ADENOSINE|.
/
/|FRAME: HOMO-CYS| is a branch point. In rats and humans approximately half of the homocysteine formed is remethylated back to methionine via two salvage pathways, one involving |FRAME: MONOMER-9225| (EC 2.1.1.13), and the other involving |FRAME:CPLX-5601| (EC 2.1.1.5) (see |FRAME:ADENOSYLHOMOCYSCAT-PWY|).
/
/The remainder of the homocysteine is degraded further. The first step is the condensation with serine to form |FRAME:L-CYSTATHIONINE|. |FRAME:CPLX-5163| catalyzes cleavage of the C-&gamma;-S bond of  |FRAME:L-CYSTATHIONINE|, yielding |FRAME:CYS|, |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE| and |FRAME:AMMONIA| in a transsulfuration reaction (see |FRAME:HOMOCYSDEGR-PWY|) |CITS: [3309559][15539209]|.

UNIQUE-ID - PWY-6122
TYPES - AIR-Biosynthesis
COMMON-NAME - 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis II
CITATIONS - PMNRXN2015:EV-COMP-HINF
COMMENT - <i>Supporting evidence for this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana col</i>: Enzyme(s) that catalyzes one or more of the key reactions in this pathway were predicted in Arabidopsis thaliana col. <A href="http://www.plantcyc.org/about/savi_pipeline.faces">[more info]</A> </B>
/
/<i>Summary from MetaCyc:</i>
/
/|FRAME: 5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-5-AMINOIMIDAZOLE "5-Amino-1-(5-phospho-&beta;-D-ribosyl)imidazole"| (AIR) is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of purine nocleotides and |FRAME: THIAMINE|. It is synthesized from |FRAME: PRPP| (PRPP) in 5 steps, which are catalyzed in most organisms by the enzymes
/|FRAME: PRPPAMIDOTRANS-CPLX|, |FRAME: GLYCRIBONUCSYN-MONOMER|, |FRAME: GART-MONOMER|,
/|FRAME: FGAMSYN-MONOMER| and |FRAME: AIRS-CPLX|, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6121|.
/
/In this variant of the pathway, found in |FRAME: TAX-562|, the third step is catalyzed by a different enzyme - |FRAME: GARTRANSFORMYL2-MONOMER|. Unlike |FRAME: GART-MONOMER|, which utilizes |FRAME: 10-FORMYL-THF| as the formyl donor, |FRAME: GARTRANSFORMYL2-MONOMER| utilizes |FRAME: FORMATE|. The two enzymes share little homology.
/
/|FRAME: TAX-562| does have |FRAME: GART-MONOMER| as well, and both enzymes are used, as can be seen in |FRAME: PWY-6277|.
