UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Describes a linear region of a polymer, such a a segment of a DNA 
/molecule or of an amino-acid chain.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.

UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Collections
TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been assigned.
/To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical transformation of some type.  It
/may involve small molecules or macromolecules.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathways
TYPES - Generalized-Reactions
COMMENT - This class is the root of a classification hierarchy for metabolic
/pathways.  Its subclasses divide pathways into groups
/based on their biological functions, and based on the classes
/of metabolites that they produce and/or consume.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION

/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segment-Enzyme-Substrates
TYPES - Compounds
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class contains reaction substrates that stand for a segment or section of an extended polymer, like a nucleic acid.
/An enzyme might typically recognize a limited motif on the polymer, but the detailed sequence of the full length polymer will not matter in such reactions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - DNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a DNA segment
COMMENT - Describes a region of a DNA molecule, such as a gene or a promoter.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.

UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Binding-Features
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-ND
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological Data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,
/which, when used in annotations, indicate that no knowledge is available about a gene product in that aspect of GO.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made

/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.
/
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.

COMMENT - Biomass is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/It is a target set of compounds, usually representative of key intermediates in the metabolism.
/In computational analysis, one often assumes the cell is alive if all the compounds
/in the biomass set can be produced from the compounds in a growth medium.

UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

COMMON-NAME - Unclassified reactions
COMMENT - Reactions that have not yet been classified either by substrate or by conversion type.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions-Classified-By-Substrate
TYPES - Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Reactions Classified By Substrate
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified according to
/the class of their substrates.  This classification scheme is orthogonal to the
/classification by conversion type, that is, reactions will have parents in both
/ontologies.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
TYPES - Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Reactions Classified By Conversion Type
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified by the type of 
/transition that occurs, whether by a change in covalent bonding, by a  weak binding interaction,
/or via a complex multistep process, etc.  This reaction ontology is orthogonal to the classification 
/of reactions by substrate classes, that is, many reactions will have parents in both ontologies.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Energy-Metabolism
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy
COMMENT - This class contains the pathways of central metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and TCA cycle), which collectively produce the 13 starting materials, sometimes termed precursor metabolites, for all cellular biosyntheses. Other degradative pathways, sometimes termed feeder pathways, feed into central metabolism. This class also contains the pathways that generate energy under various conditions of growth.  
//
UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.

COMMON-NAME - Transport
//
UNIQUE-ID - Super-Pathways
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Superpathways
COMMENT - Pathways within this class are constructed by combining individual pathways
/(elsewhere shown separately) to show relationships between them.
/In some cases those individual pathways start from a common precursor, or
/produce a common product, but they can have other relationships as well.
/Superpathways can have individual reactions as their components in addition to
/other pathways.  Superpathways can be defined recursively, that is, the
/component pathway of a Superpathway can be a base pathway or a child of
/Superpathways.  Most Superpathways will have an additional parent class
/within the pathway ontology to define their biological role.

/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Macromolecule-Modification
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Macromolecule Modification
COMMENT - This class holds pathways that describe modifications of pre-existing large macromolecules such as ptroteins.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Detoxification
TYPES - Pathways
COMMENT - This class contains pathways by which various organisms protect themselves 
/against the harmful effects of toxic compounds.

TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - A motif of which seven or more may appear in a DNA-binding protein. Each is
/characterized by two closely spaced cysteine and two histidine residues that
/serve as ligands for a single Zn2+. When bound to Zn2+ they form a module
/from which protrude amino acid side chains that interact with the bases
/partially exposed to the DNA major groove. Since in the area of contact there is
/a limited and local parallel of DNA and protein sequences, the occurrence of the
/contacting amino acid residues in the protein sequence falls into a regularity, or
/register, that creates in the protein a syllabicity. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Signal-Sequences
TYPES - Protein-Segments
COMMENT - The N-terminal portion of a secretory or membrane protein that assists it
/across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is
/synthesized, but is cleaved from the protein even before the synthesis of the

//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).

UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.

UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Production
TYPES - Regulation-of-Gene-Products
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.

/assertion.  The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion,
/but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported

/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when

/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,

COMMENT - An instance of this class should be a single reaction involving only a small number of defined participants, 
/in contrast to large complicated processes that can be better classified under the Complex-Processes
/class (e.g., transcription or translation).  Simple-Reactions should be considered indivisible at the current level of abstraction,
/but it is possible to define a decomposition of a simple reaction into a lower level set of sub-reactions, that
/exist at a different level of abstraction.  Simple-Reactions are therefore simple in comparison to
/Complex-Processes, not because they cannot be decomposed.

UNIQUE-ID - Respiration
TYPES - Energy-Metabolism
COMMENT - This class contains pathways of respiration by which various organisms generate,
/both aerobically and anaerobically, a trans-membrane ion gradient to serve as a
/source of energy.
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons out of the cell.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside
/the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-3.6.3.14 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

/to existing biologically active compounds that result in a substantial decrease in
/their biological activity. These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Activation
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Activation
COMMENT - This class contains activation pathways. In contrast to standard biosynthesis
/pathways in which a biologically active compound is synthesized from precursor
/molecules, activation pathways involve relatively minor chemical modifications to
/existing compounds that result in a substantial increase in their biological activity.
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Interconversion
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Interconversions
COMMENT - This class contains interconversion pathways. These pathways describe the
/bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule to a different form. The forward and
/backward conversions often result in significant changes in the biological activity
/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner.

UNIQUE-ID - REP-Elements
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - A Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (REP) element is a short base pair sequence capable of producing a stem-loop structure.  REP elements
/are located in different orientations and arrays between genes within an operon or at the end of an operon.  They are always found
/outside of structural genes.  Groups of REP elements are also known as BIMEs (bacterial-interspersed mosaic elements).  The actual function of these
/elements is unclear.  They may act as mRNA stabilizers, targets for DNA gyrase binding, or hot spots for transposition and recombination events.

UNIQUE-ID - Nitriles
TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - a nitrile
COMMENT - Nitriles are <b>organic</b> compounds that contain a functional group of a carbon atom linked by a triple bond to a nitrogen atom (known as a cyano group). Inorganic compounds that contain the cyano group are not called nitriles, but cyanides.
/
/The first nitrile to be synthesized (in 1782 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele) was that of formate, |FRAME: HCN|, which is an extremely toxic compound (it is an inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-1.9.3.1|). The name nitrile originates from the nitrile of benzoate, |FRAME: CPD-15582|, which was synthesized in 1844 by Hermann Fehling. Fehling named the compound nitrile, and the name was subsequently applied for all organic compounds that contain a cyano group.
/
/Nitriles occur naturally in many organisms, and over 120 naturally occurring nitriles have been isolated. It is particularly common in fruit seeds. The cyano group is very stable and is not readily metabolized.

The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: DOLICHOLP "Dolichyl phosphate"| acts as a membrane-bound carrier in the assembly of pyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharides. It can accept the respective sugar residues from the donors |FRAME: UDP-N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: CPD-12575| and |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|. When the complete oligosaccharide is transferred to a protein L-asparagine residue, |FRAME: CPD-224| is produced. It can be converted back to |FRAME: DOLICHOLP| by |FRAME: EC-3.6.1.43|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C80 dolichol diphosphate, containing 16 isoprene units.

TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - compound III
COMMENT - |FRAME: Compound-0 "Compound 0"|, |FRAME: Compound-I|, and |FRAME: Compound-II| are the names given to intermediate states of the heme-iron center that is formed at the active sites of cytochrome P-450 enzymes and peroxidases during catalysis.
/
/<b>I. Cytochrome P-450</b>
/
/In cytochrome P-450 the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a cysteine thiolate ligand. At its rest state, the iron is found at a low-spin ferric state (III valency). At this state the iron also binds a water molecule as a sixth ligand at the distal axial coordination position.
/
/Binding of a substrate to the low-spin ferric enzyme leads to displacement of the water as the sixth ligand and a high spin shift. The substrate-bound complex has a greater reduction potential and more easily accepts a single electron from
/the redox partner, which can be either |FRAME: EC-1.6.2.4 "a cytochrome P450 reductase"|, |FRAME: Ferredoxins|, or |FRAME: Cytochromes-b5|).
/
/After the first reduction, the heme iron binds oxygen, forming an oxy-heme complex. The oxygen is bound at the distal axial coordination position, from which the water molecule has been displaced. Following the transfer of the second electron from the redox partner and two subsequent protonations, a peroxo adduct is formed, known as |FRAME: Compound-0|.
/
/Next, the O-O bond is cleaved heterolytically, releasing a water molecule and leaving behind an oxygen atom with only six valence electrons. This highly active oxene oxygen removes one electron from the iron and one from the porphyrin, oxidizing the iron to the unusual valency of IV (ferryl iron) and generating an additional oxidizing equivalent that is delocalized over the porphyrin and thiolate ligands. This ferryl/porphyrin radical cation complex is known as |FRAME: Compound-I| |CITS: [21071661]|.
/When the substrate nears the active site, |FRAME: Compound-I| abstracts an electron from it, converting the substrate into a radical and becoming a protonated non-radical ferryl compound known as |FRAME: Compound-II|.
/
/At this point the substrate radical reacts with the oxygen of |FRAME: Compound-II|, forming a new carbon oxygen bond. The product is released, and the iron returns to a valency of III (compound III) |CITS: [OrtizdeMontellano15]|.
/
/<b>II. preoxidases</b>
/
/In peroxidases the proximal coordinatioin position of the heme iron, which is bound to the 4 nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole ring, is tethered to the protein via a histidine residue. |FRAME: Compound-I "Compound I"| is produced when the heme iron is oxidized by |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE|. A single one-electron reduction step of |FRAME: Compound-I| from an electron donor substrate yields |FRAME: Compound-II|, followed by a second one-electron transfer that returns the enzyme to the ferric oxidation state, thus completing the catalytic cycle. Each electron transfer event converts a substrate molecule to a radical cation, forming two such radicals during a catalytic cycle.
/
/In the presence of high concentrations of |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and the absence of a reducing substrate, |FRAME: Compound-II| can be oxidized to |FRAME: Compound-III|, a catalytically inactive form of the enzyme. |FRAME: Compound-III "Compound III"| is converted back to the resting state by spontaneous autoxidation or by oxidation with two molecules of the substrate radical cation |CITS: [18581264]|.

COMMON-NAME - a non-ribosomal peptide synthase
COMMENT - The biosynthetic system for the production of |FRAME: Nonribosomal-Peptides| operates nucleic acid-free at the protein level. The specific condensation of amino acids and related carboxyl containing compounds is directed by protein templates, and each biosynthetic step generally requires a protein module. A minimal configuration consists of an adenylation domain for amino acid activation, a thiolation domain for transfer of activated intermediates, and a condensation domain.
/
/Domains and modules are assembled at the gene level into gene clusters, which are translated into multifunctional proteins or multi-enzyme complexes, and post-translationally modified by addition of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| to the thiolation domain |CITS: [16774586]|.
/
/Since a minimal module requires 33.5 kbp of genetic sequence, and since most non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) consist of several such modules, some NRPS genes are the largest known genes |CITS: [15487945]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S cluster biosynthesis co-chaperone]
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxyhemoglobins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxyhemoglobin
COMMENT - An oxyhemoglobin is |FRAME: Hemoglobins| with bound oxygen. The oxygen is in a |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| state, with a charge of -1, while the hemoglobin iron is in an oxidized +3 state.
/
/The iron is located at the center of a |FRAME: Heme-b| group, and is bound covalently to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position of the iron can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, but only when the iron is in the ferrous (II) state.
/
/When oxygen is bound, it is in an "end-on bent" geometry where one oxygen atom binds the Fe atom and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.

UNIQUE-ID - Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number
/and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center.
/The four types are:
/
/1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these peroxiredoxins contain two conserved cysteines and are
/homodimeric enzymes where the two subunits interact in the catalytic cycle and are linked via a
/disulfide bond in the oxidized form. Eukaryotic 2-Cys proxiredoxins, which are exclusively localized
/in the chloroplast, are also shown to regulate H2O2-mediated signal transduction |CITS: [9263459]|.
/
/2. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|: these contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine and are
/preferentially expressed in plants in the embryo and aleurone |CITS: [8914536]|.
/
/3. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| (also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these can use
/thioredoxin and glutaredoxin as the reductant and can exist in multiple isoforms localized in plants in
/many subcellular compartments, including one form in plastids |CITS: [12913160]|.
/
/4. |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins| ((also known as atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins): these are
/homologues of the E. coli bacterioferritin co-migrating protein and function as monomers
/|CITS: [10998352]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein
COMMENT - |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "[Fe-S] cluster scaffold proteins"| act as a scaffold on which the [Fe-S] clusters are assembled and from which the clusters are delivered to various apoproteins.
/This type of proteins is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (in the mitochondria) and serves similar functions in all organisms.
/
/Initial studies performed with the IscU [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein from |FRAME: TAX-2336| suggested that the protein exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two distinct conformations |CITS: [12909018][14688265]|. Further studies conducted with the |FRAME: G7324 "<i>apo</i>-IscU"| of |FRAME: TAX-562| showed that the protein exists in equilibrium between a structured (S) and |FRAME: D-form-FeS-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "disordered"| (D) state |CITS: [19492851]|. The D-state of <i>apo</i>-IscU is the substrate for the |FRAME: CPLX0-248 "IscS cysteine desulfurase"|, which transfer sulfur atoms from L-cysteine molecules to cysteine residues of IscU |CITS: [22203963]|. Upon the addition of iron atoms, a [2Fe-2S] cluster forms on the scaffold protein. The cluster is transferred to other proteins via the action of chaperons, such as HscB and HscA |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an [Fe-S cluster biosynthesis chaperone]-ATP
COMMENT - This entry describes the ATP-bound form of |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones|.
/
/Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Factor-Binding
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Allosteric-Regulation-of-RNAP
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation by an alarmone, which is produced by the cell under conditions of stress.  The alarmone
/binds to RNA-Polymerase, changing its promoter preference, and thus regulating transcription initiation.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

COMMENT - Reactions in which at least one substrate is a polysaccharide macromolecule (e.g. glycogen).  This does not include small polysaccharides 
/with a completely specified chemical structure (e.g. disaccharides) -- reactions of those molecules are better classed as 
/Small-Molecule-Reactions.

COMMON-NAME - Light Interactions
COMMENT - This class is needed for special reactions with light, that are used to construct ETRs in photosynthesis.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Binding-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Binding Reactions
COMMENT - This class consists of reactions in which no covalent modification of the substrates takes place, but in which the net effect is that one substrate
/noncovalently binds to or unbinds from another molecule via weak bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds).  This class includes protein complex assembly 
/and dissociation reactions.   In reactions of this class, each of the substrates maintains its original molecular identity, meaning reactions of this class
/affect intermolecular bonds, not intramolecular bonds.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Half-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Redox Half-Reactions
COMMENT - Redox half reactions are elementary reactions, in which explicitly
/stated electrons are reducing an oxidized molecular species.  These
/reactions do not stand alone, because electrons do not occur freely.
/Instead, a half reaction must be paired with another half reaction to
/form a complete, overall transformation.
/
/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.
/
/This reaction direction allows the standard reduction potential to be
/directly recorded in the STD-REDUCTION-POTENTIAL slot, such that
/reactions of this type are comparable with each other.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transport-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Transport Reactions
COMMENT - Transport reactions are reactions in which at least one species is transported across a membrane. The species may or may not be chemically modified in the course of the reaction. Typically, transport reactions are catalysed by membrane proteins known as transporters (with the exception of simple diffusion reactions). Transporters can function without an input of energy (faciltated diffusion), or they can be driven by electrochemical potential gradients (secondary transport) or by other energy sources such as light or ATP hydrolysis (primary transport).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemical-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Chemical Reactions
COMMENT - Chemical Reactions are those for which at least one substrate molecule is chemically modified,
/meaning that either a chemical bond (covalent, ionic or coodination) is formed and/or broken,
/or that a redox modification has occurred.

//
UNIQUE-ID - AEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Aerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons out of the cell.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons inside the cell, or produce them outside
/the cell, without actually moving a proton from one compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-3.6.3.14 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.
/
/This class, which stands for aerobic respiration, contains pathways through
/which electrons flow from various organic and inorganic electron donors to
/oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.

COMMON-NAME - <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate
COMMENT - Sialic acids are an important family of related 9-carbon sugars acids, present on the surface of many different cells and functioning in a wide range of different biological processes.
/
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the
/animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
/microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
/system.
/
/N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 
/
/A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

COMMENT - While folic acid is the name given to a particular compound (see |FRAME: CPD-12826|), it is also the name given to a group of compounds based on the |FRAME: PTEROATE| skeleton and conjugated with one or more molecules of |FRAME: GLT|. Many of these compounds are also known as vitamin B9.
/
/Folic acid on its own is not biologically active, and needs to be converted to tetrahydrofolate and other active derivatives (via dihydrofolate). The biologically active forms are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. 
/Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743][12644692]|.

COMMENT - The term |FRAME: Vitamin-E| (tocochromenols) is a collective term for the eight forms of |FRAME: Tocotrienols tocotrienols| and |FRAME: Tocopherols tocopherols|, each existing as &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species.
/
/Structurally tocotrienols and tocopherols differ only in the degree of unsaturation of their side-chain. The tocotrienol chain comprises three <i>trans</i>-double bonds, whereas the tocopherol chain is fully saturated. In addition, the &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, and &delta; species of both compound groups vary in the methylation pattern of the chromanol ring |CITS:[12897790]|.
/
/Vitamin E compounds are synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms, although they are essential dietary components for animals (including humans), where they act primarily as antioxidants. Their presumed role in plants involve protection of chloroplast lipids and chlorophylls against oxidative damages. The tocotrienols are mostly found in monocots |CITS:[Padley94]| and a few dicots |CITS:[17110122]|, whereas tocopherols are wider spread in the plant kingdom and dominate in the dicots |CITS:[8827691]|.

COMMON-NAME - a vitamin K
COMMENT - Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation.
/These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts, there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/Menaquinones are synthesized by gut bacteria, and are absorbed into the blood. Thus, dietary deficiency is extremely rare in healthy individuals.
/
/There are also several synthetic forms-   vitamin K<sub>3</sub> through K<sub>9</sub>. Vitamin K<sub>3</sub> (|FRAME: CPD-3766|) is the most active of the synthetic forms.

/
/Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and for vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein |FRAME: Opsins opsin| to form the light-absorbing molecule rhodopsin (see |FRAME: PWY-6861|).
/
/Vitamin A, in the form of retinoic acid, is also an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells.
/
/In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A are |FRAME: Retinyl-Esters esters|, primarily |FRAME: CHOCOLA_A|, which are converted to retinol in the small intestine.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Vitamins-B6 Vitamin B6| is a group term for |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| (PL), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| (PN), |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE| (PM) and their 5'-phosphorylated derivatives |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| (PLP), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE-5P| (PNP) and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| (PMP), which are also referred to as vitamers. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form, and is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has recently been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [11701851]|.  Most bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|, although some bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, use a longer, more complex pathway (|FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [9696782][12896974]|. Animals do not synthesize this compound, making it an essential nutrient in their diet.
/
/PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors and participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. In humans this vitamin has a role in numerous functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to potent antioxidant activity.

/biochemical roles. 
/Porphyrins can bind metals to form complexes. The metal ion, usually with a charge of 2+ or 3+,
/resides in the central cavity formed by the loss of two protons. Many metals are found with different
/derivatives, including Fe, Mg, Ni, Co and Zn.
/The name porphyrin comes from a Greek word for purple, since most porphyrins are red to purple
/in color. More reduced porphyrins, such as corphins, are yellowish.

However, some compounds, such as |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, are often used as amino group donors by the aminotransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/This particular entry is used when the identity of the amino group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

COMMENT - Polyhydroxyalkanoates or PHAs are linear polyesters produced in nature by bacteria as a means of carbon and energy storage. 
/
/The building blocks for PHA are coenzyme A - thioesters of (<i>R</i>)-hydroxy fatty acids. Two classes of PHA synthases exist, and differ in their specificity towards short or medium chain substrates. Depending on the enzyme, the resulting PHAs are divided into two main categories:
/
/Poly (HA SCL) are formed from hydroxy fatty acids with short chain lengths of three to five carbon atoms.
/
/Poly (HA MCL) are formed from hydroxy fatty acids with medium chain lengths of six to 14 carbon atoms.
/
/A few bacteria, including Aeromonas hydrophila and Thiococcus pfennigii, can synthesize PHA that contain both short- and medium-chain hydroxy fatty acids.

COMMENT - A |FRAME: Lactones "lactone"| is a cyclic ester, the product of condensation of an alcohol group and a carboxylate group
/within the same molecule. It is characterized by a closed ring consisting of two or more carbon atoms and a single oxygen atom, with a ketone group in one of the carbons adjacent to the ring oxygen.
/
/There are several types of lactones - |FRAME: Beta-lactones| contain 3 carbons in the ring,
/|FRAME:Gamma-lactones| contains 4, |FRAME:Delta-lactones| contains 5, and |FRAME:Epsilon-lactones|
/contains 6 carbons.
/
/The most stable structure for lactones are &gamma;-lactones and &delta;-lactones, because of the
/minimal angle strain in their structure. In fact, &gamma;-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of
/dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids esterify and cyclize spontaneously to form lactones.
/&beta;-lactones, on the other hand, are not very stable.
/
/The name lactone is derived from the lactone of |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, which is called
/|FRAME: CPD-9549|, although it is really a di-lactone.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - an isoprenoid
COMMENT - The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/One method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. For example, |FRAME:CPD-11977 "this molecule"| is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/According to the other method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.  Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10. 
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/In most organisms the two hydroxyl groups are esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"|. In |FRAME: TAX-1781| and |FRAME: TAX-1809|, however, they are esterified by |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| |CITS: [3149973][3113946]|.

COMMENT - Sphingolipids are a class of lipids derived from the unsaturated aliphatic amino alcohol |FRAME: SPHINGOSINE|. They are named for the mythological Sphinx because at the time (1884) their function was enigmatic |CITS: [Thudichum84]|.
/The sphingosine backbone (often referred to as the |FRAME: Sphingoids "sphingoid base"|) is amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid, and is often also <i>O</i>-linked to a charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline. 
/
/There are three main types of sphingolipids: |FRAME: Ceramides ceramides|, |FRAME: Sphingomyelins sphingomyelins|, and |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids glycosphingolipids|. Ceramides are the most simple sphingolipids, composed of only the sphingoid base and a fatty acid.

UNIQUE-ID - Ginsenosides
TYPES - Steroids
TYPES - Triterpenes
COMMON-NAME - a ginsenoside
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ginsenosides Ginsenosides| or panaxosides are a class of steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins found exclusively in the plant genus |FRAME: TAX-4053| (ginseng). They are the principal components responsible for the pharmaceutical activities of ginseng.
/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.
/
/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the
/minor ginsenosides). Following oral intake of ginseng, the large low-solubility and poor-permeability major ginsenosides cannot be absorbed by the human body directly |CITS: [Su06]|, and are deglycosylated into smaller forms in the gastrointestinal tract by intestinal bacteria and/or digestive enzymes |CITS: [8923812]|.
/
/Glycosidase enzymes that can convert the major ginsenosides to minor ginsenosides are not common and are of commercial interest.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

/In |FRAME: TAX-224308| the main form of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly-glycerol phosphate,
/while in |FRAME: TAX-655816| the major variety of teichoic acid is a polymer of poly-ribitol phosphate.
/In both cases, the repeating units are joined together by phosphodiester linkages.  It should be noted
/that strain 168 also possesses a minor form of wall teichoic acid, which is comprised of
/poly(glucosyl <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine 1-phosphate |CITS: [4202940]|). 
/Membrane teichoic acids, also known as lipoteichoic acids, are similar polymers of glycerol phosphate, but are
/linked to glycolipid molecules located in the cell membrane |CITS: [406922]|.
/Teichoic acids were first reported in 1958 |CITS: [Armstrong58]|, after being discovered serendipitously as
/"contaminants" in bacterial extracts from <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> |CITS: [2662967]|.

/
/|FRAME:SOXYDENIT-MONOMER| and |FRAME:SOXZDENIT-MONOMER| combine with each other to form the |FRAME:CPLX-881| complex. A thiosulfate ion then combines with the free thiol group of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys138) of |FRAME:SOXYDENIT-MONOMER| to form SoxY-thiocysteine-S-thiosulfate, the first covalently bound sulfur adduct in the sulfur oxidation pathway of |FRAME: TAX-82367| |CITS: [14651972]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - apo-malonate-decarboxylases
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - [an <i>apo</i> malonate decarboxylase acyl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - Several strains of bacteria are able to utilize malonate as sole source of carbon and energy. The key reaction in the pathway is the decarboxylation of malonate to acetate, which is catalyzed by malonate decarboxylase. Malonate is a rather inert compound, and its decarboxylation under physiological conditions requires an activation step, in which malonate forms a thioester derivative.
/
/Malonate decarboxylase is an enzyme complex composed of three subunits, one of which is a dedicated acyl-carrier protein (acp). The acp protein is synthesized in an <i>apo</i> form, and is converted to its <i>holo</i> form by the covalent binding of the prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to a serine residue. This prosthetic group is very unusual and the only other enzyme known to use it is |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| (see |FRAME: P2-PWY|).

COMMON-NAME - [an <i>apo</i> citrate-lyase acyl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate |CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.

In addition, there are two divalent cations binding sites |CITS: [235885]|.
/
/ATP phosphorylates glutamate to form ADP and an acyl-phosphate intermediate, &gamma;-glutamyl phosphate, which reacts with ammonia, forming glutamine and inorganic phosphate. The ADP and phosphate groups are released only after the ammonium ion binds and glutamine is released |CITS: [7904828][10708854]|.

/
/The protein complex shares a considerable degree of similarity with the MoFe protein of nitrogenase (|FRAME: NifDK NifDK|). However, it contains |FRAME: CPD-7| (termed the O-cluster) instead of |FRAME: 8FE-7S| (P-cluster).

/Molybdenum is transferred by |FRAME: holo-NifQ NifQ|, which carries it as part of a different molybdenum-iron-sulfur cluster (which is only used as a molybdenum donor to the nitrogenase |FRAME: CPD-41|) |CITS: [18697929]|, and |FRAME: HOMO-CIT|, produced by |FRAME: G-44194 NifV|, is transferred by an unknown mechanism that involves NifH |CITS: [9294461]|.
/
/The resulting M-cluster is then relocated from the surface to the binding site within NifEN. In the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-354| the M-cluster is held in its new place by interactions with Cys250 and Asn418, and the homocitrate is anchored by interactions with Arg402. The complex carrying the fully functional M-cluster is referred to as |FRAME: NifEN-M-cluster "a <i>holo</i>-NifEN"| |CITS: [21212358]|. 
/
/Despite the incomplete knowledge, it has clearly been shown that Mo and homocitrate are incorporated into the precursor while it is bound to NifEN, and that this cluster is transformed into a fully matured |FRAME: CPD-41| and inserted into its target location in the MoFe protein (the NifDK component of the nitrogenase complex) without the aid of a carrier or chaperone |CITS: [17050696]|.

/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Form| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

UNIQUE-ID - Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a [co-chaperone]-[scaffold protein-(2Fe-2S)] complex
COMMENT - Two chaperone proteins have been shown to play an important role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. The two proteins, which were named chaperone and co-chaperone, are involved in the later part of the process, following the formation of an [2Fe-2S] cluster on the scaffold protein, and help in the transfer of the cluster from the scaffold protein to a recepient <i>apo</i>-iron-sulfur protein.
/
/The |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Co-Chaperones co-chaperone| acts first, by binding to |FRAME: CD-SP-2Fe2S-Complex| (a protein complex that includes |FRAME: L-Cysteine-Desulfurases| and |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins| with an already-assembled [2Fe-2S] cluster), displacing the cysteine desulfurase and forming |FRAME: Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex|.
/
/The co-chaperone guides this complex to the other |FRAME: FeS-Cluster-Chaperones-ATP chaperone| (an ATPase protein with a pre-bound ATP molecule), where it binds to a nucleotide-binding domain, forming |FRAME: Chap-ATP-Co-chaperone-SP-2Fe2S-Complex "a ternary complex"|.
/
/At this point the complex is ready to transfer its [2Fe2S] cluster to a receipient. When a suitable acceptor protein approaches the complex one or two of its thiol groups attack the cluster's iron atoms, liberating one or two of the scaffold protein cluster ligands and leading to a conformational change in the co-chaperone that activates the ATPase activity of the main chaperone. Cleavage of the bound ATP leads to an additional conformational change that results in a fundumental change |CITS: [11053447][15485839]|.  A binding site on the ligand binding domain of the chaperone protein opens up and binds the scaffold protein in its disordered state. The conversion of the scaffold protein to its disordered state releases both the Fe-S cluster, which moves to the acceptor protein, and the co-chaperone. 
/
/This is followed by an exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, which restores the chaperone to its active state and releases the scaffold protein, both of which become ready to take part in the next cycle |CITS: [23333622]|.

UNIQUE-ID - DsrC-sulfur-carrier-proteins
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a DsrC sulfur carrier protein
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.

COMMENT - Hemoglobin is a protein complex found in the red blood cells of all vertebtrates that is involved in oxygen transport from the lung or gills to the various peripheral tissues. It is also found the tissues of some invertebrates, a homologs of hemoglobin are found in plants and bacteria.
/
/Mammalian hemoglobins are heterotetramers with an &alpha;<sub>2</sub>&beta;<sub>2</sub> composition, and each subunit contains a tightly bound |FRAME: Heme-b| molecule. The iron of the |FRAME: Heme-b| group is bound covalently to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of a histidine residue (known as the proximal histidine) below the porphyrin ring. A sixth position of the iron can reversibly bind oxygen by a coordinate covalent bond, but only when the iron is in the ferrous (II) state.
/
/When oxygen is bound, it is in an "end-on bent" geometry where one oxygen atom binds the Fe atom and the other protrudes at an angle. When oxygen is not bound, a very weakly bonded water molecule fills the site, forming a distorted octahedron.
/
/The subunit identity changes with different developmental stages and among different forms of the protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Phosphatase-2A
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a phosphatase-2A
COMMENT - Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) removes the serine- or threonine-bound phosphate group from a wide range of phosphoproteins. The enzyme is very versatile owing to a large number of regulatory subunits and its ability to interact with numerous other proteins. The PP2A holoenzyme is a dimeric or trimeric protein built up from a catalytic subunit (PP2AC) (catalytic subunit of PP2A), a second constant regulatory subunit, and a third variable subunit. Three major classes of third subunits are currently described. Each of the three subunits of PP2A exists in at least two isoforms, thereby leading to a great variety of possible holoenzyme conformations, all with potential different substrate affinities and catalytic activities.
/
/The common heterodimeric core of the human enzyme consists of |FRAME: HS03696-MONOMER PPP2CA|, a 36 kDa catalytic subunit, and |FRAME: ENSG00000105568-MONOMER PPP2R1A|, a 65 kDa constant regulatory subunit.

UNIQUE-ID - Hydrogenases
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a hydrogenase
COMMENT - This class of proteins represents any hydrogenase that has been activated.
/
/<b>General Background </b>
/
/Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.
/
/Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 
/
/While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 
/
/ [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.
/Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.
/
/In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

UNIQUE-ID - Gramicidin-S-synthetases
TYPES - Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases
COMMON-NAME - a gramicidin-S synthetase
COMMENT - Gramicidin-S synthetase is composed of two large, multidomain polypeptides (reviewed in |CITS: [15487945]| and in |CITS: [16895337]|). Gramicidin-S synthetase I comprises module 1, which contains three domains: an adenylation domain, a thiolation domain and an epimerization domain |CITS: [7534306]|. The thiolation domain is referred to in the literature as the T, holo-[acyl-carrier protein], ACP, peptidyl-carrier protein, or PCP domain (the latter two names are used in the case of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases). The thiolation domain is generated from an apo form that is posttranslationally modified by phosphopantetheinyltransferase-catalyzed covalent attachment of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| (derived from |FRAME: CO-A|) to a conserved serine residue.
/
/Gramicidin-S synthetase II comprises modules 2-5. These modules each contain adenylation, condensation and thiolation 
/domains, with module 5 also containing a thioesterase domain (In |CITS:[16895337]| |CITS:[8939709]|).
/

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an <i>S</i>-sulfanyl-[ThiI sulfur-carrier protein]
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

COMMON-NAME - an opsin
COMMENT - The opsin proteins are the retinal-binding visual pigments found in the photoreceptor cells in the retinas of mammalian eyes.
/An opsin is arranged into a bundle of seven transmembrane &alpha;-helices connected by six loops. In rod cells the opsin molecules are embedded in the membranes of the disks which are entirely inside of the cell.  In cone cells the disks are defined by the cell's plasma membrane so that the N-terminus head extends outside of the cell. 
/
/|FRAME: CPD-881| binds covalently to a lysine on the transmembrane helix nearest the C-terminus of opsin through a Schiff base linkage. Formation of the Schiff base linkage involves removing the oxygen atom from retinal and two hydrogen atoms from the free amino group of lysine, releasing a water molecule.
/
/While mammals use retinal exclusively as the opsin chromophore, other groups of animals additionally use four chromophores closely related to retinal, including (3,4)-didehydroretinal (many fish and amphibians), (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal (most insects), (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal (Cyclorrhaphans), and (4R)-4-hydroxyretinal (Firefly squid).

UNIQUE-ID - Thioredoxin
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxins are small redox proteins known to be present in nearly all organisms and function in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxins have a characteristic tertiary structure known as the thioredoxin fold, and contain two vicinal cysteines in a CXXC motif. These two cysteines form the cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site, and allow thioredoxin to reduce other proteins.
/
/The thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavoenzyme |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|, which utilizes NADPH as the electron source. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates. In addition, thioredoxins can also act as electron donors to certain proteins, such as the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|.
/
/|FRAME: Glutaredoxins Glutaredoxins| share many of the functions of thioredoxins, but are reduced by glutathione rather than a specific reductase. 
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

/The activity of the enzyme starts with the transfer of |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from an |FRAME: Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1 E1|-ubiquitin complex to a catalytic L-cysteine residue at its active site by transesterification. Once loaded with ubiquitin, the enzyme binds a target protein and transfers the ubiquitin to a lysine residue of that protein.
/
/Regular E2 proteins transfer the ubiquitin to one of several |FRAME: E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins "E3 ubiquitin-carrier proteins"| (or E3 enzymes). The E3 enzyme also binds the target protein substrate, and catalyzes the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 cysteine to the lysine residue on the target protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Sulfatases
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a sulfatase
COMMENT - Sulfatases are enzymes of the esterase class that catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate esters.
/Different types of sulfatases act on different ranges of substrates, including aromatic compounds, steroids, carbohydrates and proteins. Many types of sulfatases received their EC number, including |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.1|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.1|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.2|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.4|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.8|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.12|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.6.13|, and |FRAME: EC-3.10.1.1| (the latter acts on a sulfur-nitrogen bond).
/
/Sulfatases play important roles in the cycling of sulfur in the environment, in the degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and glycolipids in the lysosome, and in remodelling sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular space.
/
/All eukaryotic sulfatases contain a highly conserved hexapeptide L/V-FGly-X-P-S-R, which is found in the N-terminal region. The X residue contains a hydroxyl or thiol group, while formylglycine (FGly, also known as |FRAME: 2-AMINOMALONATE-SEMIALDEHYDE|) is a unique modification of an L-cysteine residue |CITS: [9342345]|.

UNIQUE-ID - SAMP
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a small archaeal modifier protein
COMMENT - Small archaeal modifier proteins (SAMPs) are ubiquitin-like proteins that are covalently attached to proteins in archaea. Like ubiquitin, these proteins possess a &beta;-grasp fold and carboxy-terminal diglycine motif, and as in ubiquitinylation, the C-terminal carboxylate forms an isopeptide bond with the &epsilon;-amino group of lysine residues on target proteins |CITS: [20054389]|. In addition, it has been shown that the C-terminal glycine of SAMP2 can form a bond with Lys 58 of SAMP2 itself, forming poly-SAMP chains, as in the case of polyubiquitinylation. The process of modification by SAMP has been termed SAMPylation.
/
/It has also been shown that SAMP proteins are involved in sulfur transfer |CITS: [21368171]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a mitogen-activated protein kinase
COMMENT - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine.
/
/Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.

UNIQUE-ID - NifB
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a NifB protein
COMMENT - NifB is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of the |FRAME: CPD-41| of [MoFe]-nitrogenases, and contains the CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C motif characteristic of the radical SAM superfamily. Sequence analysis suggested that in addition to a radical SAM [4Fe-4S] cluster, NifB contains two other |FRAME: CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters"|. It is now known to catalyze the condensation of these two clusters into a single |FRAME: CPD-18407|, inserting a carbide atom at the center of the molecule |CITS: [23019652][25477518]|.
/
/Early attempts at characterizing a His-tagged form of NifB from |FRAME: TAX-354| were unsuccessful due to the extreme instability of NifB in aqueous solutions. The problem was circumvented by creating a fusion between NifB and NifN, resulting in successful isolation of a NifE(N-B) complex |CITS: [21551100]|. It should be noted that such a fusion occurs naturally in the bactrerium |FRAME: TAX-1501|.
/
/The NifE(N-B) complex was fully active as a |FRAME: CPD-41| donor for a cofactor-deficient MoFe protein (the dinitrogenase component of [MoFe]-nitrogenase enzymes). Metal, activity, ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses established the presence of two transient clusters, designated K-cluster and |FRAME: CPD-18407|, respectively, on the NifEN-B fusion protein. The K-cluster was found to consist of a pair of [4Fe-4S] clusters, while the L-cluster is a [8Fe-9S-C] cluster |CITS: [16423898][21726031][21212358]|.
/
/The fusion protein was overexpressed in |FRAME: TAX-354| in the presence of all accessory proteins except the nitrogenase components (NifH and NifDK). In the absence of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| cluster maturation was halted at the NifB state. Upon addition of |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|, the EPR signal of [4Fe-4S] clusters was replaced by the signal of the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster.

COMMON-NAME - a NifB protein with an L-cluster
COMMENT - NifB is a protein involved in the biosynthesis of the |FRAME: CPD-41| of [MoFe]-nitrogenases, and contains the CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C motif characteristic of the radical SAM superfamily. Sequence analysis suggested that in addition to a radical SAM [4Fe-4S] cluster, NifB contains two other |FRAME: CPD-7 "[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters"|. It is now known to catalyze the condensation of these two clusters into a single |FRAME: CPD-18407|, inserting a carbide atom at the center of the molecule |CITS: [23019652][25477518]|.
/
/Early attempts at characterizing a His-tagged form of NifB from |FRAME: TAX-354| were unsuccessful due to the extreme instability of NifB in aqueous solutions. The problem was circumvented by creating a fusion between NifB and NifN, resulting in successful isolation of a NifE(N-B) complex |CITS: [21551100]|. It should be noted that such a fusion occurs naturally in the bactrerium |FRAME: TAX-1501|.
/
/The NifE(N-B) complex was fully active as a |FRAME: CPD-41| donor for a cofactor-deficient MoFe protein (the dinitrogenase component of [MoFe]-nitrogenase enzymes). Metal, activity, ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses established the presence of two transient clusters, designated K-cluster and |FRAME: CPD-18407|, respectively, on the NifEN-B fusion protein. The K-cluster was found to consist of a pair of [4Fe-4S] clusters, while the L-cluster is a [8Fe-9S-C] cluster |CITS: [16423898][21726031][21212358]|.
/
/The fusion protein was overexpressed in |FRAME: TAX-354| in the presence of all accessory proteins except the nitrogenase components (NifH and NifDK).

COMMENT - Wnt proteins act as ligands to Frizzled family receptors, which then pass the biological signal to the Dishevelled protein inside the cell. They participate in a group of signal transduction pathways known as the Wnt signaling pathways. Three such pathways have been characterized: the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway, and the noncanonical Wnt/calcium pathway.
/
/There are many Wnt proteins, which form a diverse family of secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins of 350400 amino acids in length. Palmitoylation initiates targeting of the Wnt protein to the plasma membrane for secretion, and also allows the Wnt protein to bind its receptor due to the covalent attachment of the palmitoate moiety. Wnt proteins also undergo glycosylation |CITS: [17117926]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Proteins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an iron-sulfur protein
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

UNIQUE-ID - Histones
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a histone
COMMENT - Histones are proteins found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells that package and order the nuclear DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. The histones act as spools around which DNA can wind, and play an important role in gene regulation. For example, a human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but when wound around histones, it is compacted into a structure of about 90  &mu;m.
/
/There are five major families of histones: H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, all of which are involved in the formation of a single nucleosome. Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (also known as the core histones) assemble to form one octameric nucleosome core particle, around which the DNA wraps in a left-handed super-helical turn. A single molecule of histone H1 (known as the linker histone) then binds to the nucleosome, locking the DNA in place.
/
/Two higher-order structures involving multiple nucleosomes are formed -  a 30 nm fiber (forming an irregular zigzag) and a 100 nm fiber. The H1 histone also binds to the "linker DNA" (approximately 20-80 nucleotides in length) region between nucleosomes, helping stabilize the zig-zagged 30 nm fiber.
/
/The complex structure of multiple nucleosomes, including the histones and the DNA wrapped around them, is known as chromatin.

UNIQUE-ID - Release-factors
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a release factor
COMMENT - A release factor is a protein that allows for the termination of translation by recognizing the termination codon or stop codon in an mRNA sequence.
/
/In the standard genetic code, there are three mRNA stop codons: UAG (amber), UAA (ochre), and UGA (opal).
/
/Prokaryotes have two release factors that recognize different stop codons: RF1 recognizes the termination codons UAA and UAG, while RF2 recognizes UAA and UGA.
/
/Eukaryotes have only a single release factor, eRF1, that recognizes all three termination codons.

UNIQUE-ID - LysW
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - [LysW L-2-aminoadipate carrier protein]
COMMENT - LysW is an &alpha;-aminoadipate carrier protein used by many archaebacterial species for the synthesis of the amino acid |FRAME: LYS|. 
/
/The amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, an intermediate in the archaeal L-lysine biosynthetic pathway (which is also found in the hyperthermophilic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-274|), is covalently linked to the &gamma;-carboxyl group of the last C-terminal residue of LysW (Glu54 in |FRAME: TAX-274|) by a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5207| gene. LysW not only protects the amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, but also serves as a carrier protein, which is easily recognized by lysine biosynthesis enzymes. In this way all subsequent transformations leading to L-lyine occur when the amino acid is attached to LysW, and the |FRAME: CPD-468| side chain is converted to a C-terminal lysyl side chain in the LysW-conjugated form. Eventually, a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5222| gene releases the mature amino acid |CITS: [19620981]|.
/
/It has been shown that at least in |FRAME: TAX-2284| LysW is also used as a carrier protein for |FRAME: GLT| during the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ARG| |CITS: [23434852]|.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
COMMENT - |FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.
/
/|FRAME: EC-2.7.12.2 "EC 2.7.12.2"|, |FRAME: MAP-kinase-MEK "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase"| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes. MAP2K enzymes also need to be activated by phosphorylation prior to becoming active. The activation is carried out by the serine/threonine protein kinase |FRAME: EC-2.7.11.25 "EC 2.7.11.25"|,  MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K or MEKK).

UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquitin-carrier-proteins-E2
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2
COMMENT - The ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2 (also called ubiquitin-carrier-proteins, E2 enzymes, or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), perform the second step in the ubiquitination reaction. 
/
/The activity of the enzyme starts with the transfer of |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from an |FRAME: Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1 E1|-ubiquitin complex to a catalytic L-cysteine residue at the active site by transesterification. Once loaded with ubiquitin, the E2 enzyme binds one of several |FRAME: E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins "E3 ubiquitin-carrier proteins"| (or E3 enzymes) via a structurally conserved binding region. The E3 enzyme also binds the target protein substrate, and catalyzes the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 cysteine to a lysine residue on the target protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme
COMMENT - Ubiquitin-activating enzymes, also known as E1 enzymes, catalyze the first step in the ubiquitination reaction. The E1 enzyme binds ATP-Mg2+ and |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin|, and catalyzes ubiquitin C-terminal acyl adenylation. A catalytic L-cysteine residue of the E1 enzyme then attacks the ubiquitin-AMP complex through acyl substitution, creating a thioester bond and an AMP leaving group.
/
/This active form of ubiquitin, bound to the E1 enzyme, is transferred to an |FRAME: Ubiquitin-carrier-proteins-E2 "E2 ubiquitin-carrier protein"| through a transthioesterification reaction, in which an E2 catalytic L-cysteine attacks the backside of the E1-ubiquitin complex.
SYNONYMS - ubiquitin-activating enzyme

UNIQUE-ID - E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - ubiquitin transferase E3
COMMENT - E3 ubiquitin-transferases (also called ubiquitin-carrier proteins and incorrectly ubiquitin ligases or E3 ubiquitin ligases) are enzymes that transfer |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from a ubiquitin-|FRAME: Ubiquitin-carrier-proteins-E2 E2| complex to the target protein that is to be ubiquitinated. The enzyme attaches the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein via an isopeptide bond.
/Since no ATP is required for this transfer operation, these enzymes are transferases and not ligases.
/
/E3 ubiquitin-carrier proteins are also involved in poly-ubiquitination, building poly-ubiquitin chains by adding a second ubiquitin to the first, a third to the second, and so forth.
/
/Chains can be added to different lysines on the ubiquitin molecule. Chains at different locations result in different fate for the ubiquitinated protein. For example, human proteins with chains of ubiquitin molecules connected via Lys48 are targeted to the proteasome for degradation, while proteins with chains of ubiquitin molecules connected via Lys63 seem to be important for DNA repair.
/
/E3 ubiquitin-transferases contain a domain for binding the E2-ubiquitin complex and a substrate-specific domain for binding the target protein. Many E2- and substrate-binding domains exist, and depending on these domains the E3 ubiquitin-transferases have been classified into several families. Common families include |FRAME: HECT-E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins HECT| (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) and |FRAME: RING-E3-ubiquitin-carrier-proteins RING| (Really Interesting New Gene).

UNIQUE-ID - N-terminal-specific-UCP-E2
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - an N-terminal E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
COMMENT - Most |FRAME: Ubiquitin-carrier-proteins-E2 "ubiquitin-carrier-proteins"|, also known as E2 enzymes or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, catalyze the transfer of |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from an |FRAME: Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1 "E1"|-ubiquitin complex to one of their L-cysteine residues. The ubiquitin is then transferred either to a ubiquitin transferase (E3) or directly to the target protein, as in the case of |FRAME: EC-2.3.2.24|, which transfer ubiquitin to a lysine group of a target protein.
/
/This type of E2 proteins also transfer the ubiquitin from |FRAME: Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1 "E1"|-ubiquitin complex to a target protein, but it only ubiquinates the &alpha;-amino groups of the N-termini of target proteins.

UNIQUE-ID - E3-independent-UCP-E2

COMMON-NAME - an E3-independent ubiquitin-carrier-protein E2
COMMENT - Most |FRAME: Ubiquitin-carrier-proteins-E2 "ubiquitin-carrier-proteins"|, also known as E2 enzymes or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, catalyze the transfer of |FRAME: Ubiquitins ubiquitin| from an |FRAME: Ubiquitin-activating-proteins-E1 "E1"|-ubiquitin complex to one of several ubiquitin ligases (or E3 enzymes), which in turn catalyze the transfer of the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein.
/
/However, some E2 proteins act independent of the E3 ligases, and catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from an E1-ubiquitin complex directly to a lysine residue on the target protein. While confusingly they are also referred to as E2 proteins, we refer to them here as E3-independent ubiquitin-carrier-proteins E2.

/
/L16 interacts with tRNA |CITS: [6352325][6363130][2182127]| and can be crosslinked to aminoacylated tRNA in the A and P site |CITS: [386278][8524654]|.  Conserved residues within L16 were shown to be involved in the translocation of tRNA from the A to the P site |CITS: [24186064]|.  L16 is located within 21 &Aring; of nucleotide C2475 of 23S rRNA, near the peptidyltransferase center |CITS: [7529559]|.  L16 and a histidine residue within the N-terminal domain of L16 may be important for the correct conformation of the peptidyltransferase center |CITS: [6254759][3549294][3297687]|.  L16 is important for release factor 2-dependent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis |CITS: [6355096]|.  The antibiotics chloramphenicol |CITS: [4365366][4599619]| and virginiamycin S |CITS: [95947]| interact with L16 within the ribosome.
/
/L16 is one of six ribosomal proteins that is completely lost from ribosomes in post-stationary cells |CITS: [6201363]|.
/
/The N-terminal methionine of L16 appears to be methylated |CITS: [786730][323502]|, and additional posttranslational modifications of the protein are present |CITS: [10094780][22649682]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycine-Cleavage-Complex-H
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a glycine-cleavage complex H protein
COMMENT - The glycine-cleavage complex (glycine decarboxylase complex) is a loosely-associated multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of glycine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and a methylene group, in a multistep reaction (in |CITS: [15791207]|).  The methylene group, carried by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF|, enters cellular one-carbon metabolism. In mammals, it is the primary pathway for glycine catabolism |CITS: [6402507]|.
/
/The glycine cleavage complex is composed of four different proteins: the P-protein (|FRAME: EC-1.4.4.2|); the T-protein (|FRAME: EC-2.1.2.10|); the L-protein (|FRAME: EC-1.8.1.4|); and the H-protein (lipoyl-carrier protein, a non-enzyme that contains a lipoyl group that interacts successively with the three other components of the complex during the enzymatic reactions.
/
/The H-protein is reduced as it shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P-protein to the T-protein and is reoxidized by the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. GcvH functions as a substrate for the three enzymes of the gcv complex.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor. Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|. The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins, and GST-related dithiol proteins. The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif; while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site. The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif |CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However, unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome
COMMENT - Cytochromes are proteins containing |FRAME: Hemes| groups and are primarily involved in electron transport.
/They were initially described in 1884 by MacMunn as respiratory pigments (originally named myohematin or histohematin) |CITS: [MacMunn84]| and were renamed cytochromes after being rediscovered in 1920.
/
/In general cytochromes are named based on the type of heme they carry - cytochrome <i>c</i> contains a heme <i>c</i>, while cytochrome <i>aa</i><sub>3</sub> contains both a heme <i>a</i> and a heme <i>a</i><sub>3</sub>. Often cytochromes are further designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt <i>c</i><sub>559</sub>.
/
/In most cytochromes the heme group contains an iron ion, which interconverts between its reduced state (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and its oxidized state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>). Thus, cytochromes are reduced by accepting an electron from a donor, and deliver the electron to the oxidized form of an acceptor, reducing it in the process. Cytochromes play an indispensable role in most respiratory chains and in photosynthesis.

TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a retinochrome
COMMENT - Retinochrome is a photosensitive pigment located primarily in the inner portions of the visual ceils of cephalopods. Its absorption spectrum resembles that of |FRAME: Rhodopsins rhodopsin|, but its chromophore is |FRAME: RETINAL|, which light isomerizes to |FRAME: CPD-881|, the reverse of the situation in rhodopsin |CITS: [6036171][4512007][235007]|. The function of retinochrome is believed to be the regeneration of |FRAME: CPD-881| from |FRAME: RETINAL| produced by the rhodopsin photoreaction |CITS: [2626821][1541344]|.
/
/Retinochrome is synthesized in the |FRAME: Apo-Retinochromes "<i>apo</i> form"|. The active retinochrome is produced by the reversibly covalent binding of |FRAME: RETINAL|. Isomerization of |FRAME: RETINAL| into |FRAME: CPD-881| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change, resulting in the less stable |FRAME: Metaretinochromes metaretinochrome| form.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.

/
/The the A domain catalyzes ATP-dependent activation of medium chain (C6-C14) fatty acids (with a preference for |FRAME: CPD-3617|), which are loaded on the ACP domain.

COMMENT - DsbD is an inner membrane protein that transfers electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the
/periplasmic substrate proteins DsbC, DsbG and CcmG. DsbD consists of three domains: a periplasmic
/N-terminal domain (nDsbD), a central transmembrane (TM) domain (tmDsbD) with eight predicted TM
/helices and a periplasmic C-terminal domain (cDsbD) |CITS: [10760137]|.
/
/The electron cascade is
/initiated by the reduction of tmDsbD by thioredoxin, cDsbD then shuttles electrons from tmDsbD to
/nDsbD and reduced nDsbD passes the electrons onto the periplasmic substrate proteins. It appears that
/unlike DsbB, which has a bound quinone for electron transfer |CITS: [10854438]|, tmDsbD is capable of
/shuffling electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm without involvement of an additional cofactor
/|CITS: [18571669]|. Transfer of electrons across the membrane is thought to occur via thiol disulfide exchange reactions |CITS:[12925743], [17641688], [19258316]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Sulfur-Carrier-Proteins-ThiI
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a ThiI sulfur-carrier protein
COMMENT - ThiI is a bifunctional enzyme that is required both for the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine and for the conversion of uridine to 4-thiouridine at position 8 in tRNA |CITS: [6178725][9592144]|.
/The protein contains several domains, and different domains are involved in tRNA modification and thiazole formation. The THUMP and AANH domains are required for tRNA modification, while the only domain necessary for thiozole formation is the C-terminal rhodanese domain (as shown for the enzyme from Salmonella |CITS: [21724998]|).
/
/Regarding thiazole biosynthesis, it has been shown that the thiI gene plays an essential role in the formation of a thiocarboxylate on the carboxylic acid group of the carboxyl-terminal glycine of the ThiS protein. ThiS isolated
/from a thiI-defficient strain does not contain this modification |CITS: [9632726]|.
/
/Regarding uridine modification, the enzyme adenylates the tRNA uridine and transfers sulfur from a persulfide formed on the protein. It is specific for the U8 residue of tRNA; the substrate specificity appears to be conferred by the secondary and tertiary structure of tRNA |CITS: [15037613]|.
/The ThiI protein, but not the IscS protein, was shown to interact with tRNA.  <i>In vitro</i> studies using radiolabelled sulfur showed transfer of sulfur from IscS to ThiI; if tRNA is included, the sulfur appears to be incorporated into the tRNA in a ThiI- and ATP-dependent manner.  Based on these results, a model for mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine via IscS and ThiI to U8 of tRNA has been presented |CITS: [10753862]|.

COMMENT - The small subunits of MPT synthases from different organisms (such as the bacterial MoaD protein) contain a double glycine motif at the C terminus. The free carboxylate group of the terminal glycine is activated by an accessory protein (MoeB in bacteria, MOCS3 in humans and Cnx5 in plants) to a carboxy-adenylate form, which is then sulfurylated by a sulfurase (|FRAME: CPLX0-248 IscS| in bacteria, the rhodanese-like domain of molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase in eukaryotes), resulting in a thiocarboxylate. Each small subunit in the complex donates the sulfur atom of the thiocarboxylate to |FRAME: PRECURSOR-Z|, resulting in formation of |FRAME: CPD-4| |CITS: [11459846]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Rhodopsins

TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - a rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013]|. 
/
/When a photon is absorbed by the retinal chromophore, it isomerizes from |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| (while bound to the protein) and induces a conformational change in the opsin. In mammalian cells this process is known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations: 
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and binding of the protein arrestin. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and |FRAME: Aporhodopsins opsin| |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607][8639666]|.
/
/The retinal chromophore is connected to the protein via a Schiff base (a double bond between a carbon in the chromophore to a nitrogen in a lysine residue of opsin) |CITS: [Harosi95]|. The structure shown here is a generic representation, as not all rhodopsins utilize this particular form of retinal.

COMMON-NAME - a metarhodopsin II
COMMENT - Photon absorption by |FRAME: CPD-881| bound to |FRAME:Rhodopsins| converts it to the <i>all-trans</i> form, which is a strong agonist for opsin. The photoisomerization of the retinoid induces a series of rapid conformational changes of the pigment molecule that convert it to the physiologically active state (|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Meta II"|) within ~1 milisecond. Meta II is the form of rhodopsin that activates the visual G-protein, transducin, triggering a second messenger cascade. 
/
/Following activation of transducin, |FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "metarhodopsin II"| is deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and arrestin binding.

TYPES - Polyketide-Synthases
COMMON-NAME - a polyketide synthase containing an [acp] domain
COMMENT - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are found in soil and marine filamentous bacteria, as well as in fungi and higher plants, and are responsible for producing such therapeutically important natural products as erythromycin and lovastatin. Analogous to the fatty acid synthases, PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an ACP. The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.
/
/ACP proteins are synthesized in their |FRAME: apo-ACP "<i>apo</i> inactive form"|, and are activated by attachment of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety, removed from |FRAME: CO-A|, to an |FRAME: SER| residue, in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.7| (4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase) |CITS: [18059524]|. The structure shown here depicts the |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety attached to the serine residue.

UNIQUE-ID - Ox-Thioredoxin
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Thioredoxin
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized ferredoxin [iron-sulfur] cluster
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-Rubredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Rubredoxins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized rubredoxin
COMMENT - Rubredoxins are found in some bacteria and archaea. Unlike |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins"|, rubredoxins do not contain inorganic sulfide. Instead they contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>. Rubredoxins participate in electron transfer in biological systems, and transfer a single electron. During the process, the central iron atom changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states.
/
/The reduction potential of a rubredoxin is typically in the range +50 mV to -50 mV.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ox-Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

TYPES - Methylamine-specific-corrinoids
TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a [Co(II) methylamine-specific corrinoid protein]
COMMENT - The pathways for methanogenesis from methylated C1 compounds follow a similar route. Methyl transfer from the electron acceptor to |FRAME: CoM| is carried out by enzyme systems composed of three polypeptides: a protein that binds a corrinoid prosthetic group |CITS: [9654068]|, and two methyltransferases, named MT1 and MT2. MT1 and the corrinoid protein form a tight heterodimeric complex. When the substrate binds to this complex, MT1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from the substrate to the corrinoid group. MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to 
/|FRAME: CoM| |CITS:[6438059]|. Individual MT1 and corrinoid-binding proteins are highly specific for their respective substrate, and exhibit little or no activity with similar substrates |CITS: [6615129][9195968][9006042][9654067][10852929]|.
/
/Coenzyme M (CoM) is methylated during methanogenesis from monomethyamine in a reaction catalyzed by three proteins. Using monomethylamine, a 52-kDa polypeptide termed |FRAME:CPLX-7101| (MMAMT) methylates the corrinoid cofactor bound to a second polypeptide, |FRAME: MONOMER-12209| (MMCP). Methylated MMCP then serves as a substrate for |FRAME:MONOMER-12205| (MT2-A), which methylates CoM.

COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that is isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

/
/Most of the characterized electron-transferring flavoproteins belong to a single group.

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a malonyl-[<i>holo</i> malonate decarboxylase acyl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - Several strains of bacteria are able to utilize malonate as sole source of carbon and energy. The key reaction in the pathway is the decarboxylation of malonate to acetate, which is catalyzed by malonate decarboxylase.

/|FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| and |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins|.
/

UNIQUE-ID - 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins
TYPES - Peroxiredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a 1-Cys peroxiredoxin
COMMENT - Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria,
/archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|.
/All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine
/(the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate.
/They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity.
/Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.
/
/Reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin,
/cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.
/
/In plants, peroxiredoxins are categorized into four subclasses based on subunit composition, number
/and location of the conserved cysteine residues, and the sequence environment of the catalytic center.
/The four types are |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|, |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins|,
/|FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins| and |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins|.
/
/|FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins| contains a single conserved catalytic cysteine and is
/preferentially expressed in plants in the embryo and aleurone |CITS: [8914536]|.

TYPES - Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a [disordered-form [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein]
COMMENT - |FRAME: Iron-Sulfur-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "[Fe-S] cluster scaffold proteins"| act as a scaffold on which the [Fe-S] clusters are assembled and from which the clusters are delivered to various apoproteins.
/This type of proteins is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (in the mitochondria) and serves similar functions in all organisms.
/
/Initial studies performed with the IscU [Fe-S] cluster scaffold protein from |FRAME: TAX-2336| suggested that the protein exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two distinct conformations |CITS: [12909018][14688265]|. Further studies conducted with the |FRAME: G7324 "<i>apo</i>-IscU"| of |FRAME: TAX-562| showed that the protein exists in equilibrium between a structured (S) and |FRAME: D-form-FeS-Cluster-Scaffold-Proteins "disordered"| (D) state |CITS: [19492851]|. The D-state of <i>apo</i>-IscU is the substrate for the |FRAME: CPLX0-248 "IscS cysteine desulfurase"|, which transfer sulfur atoms from L-cysteine molecules to cysteine residues of IscU |CITS: [22203963]|. Upon the addition of iron atoms, a [2Fe-2S] cluster forms on the scaffold protein. The cluster is transferred to other proteins via the action of chaperons, such as HscB and HscA |CITS: [23333622]|.

COMMENT - Transmembrane transport requires transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Composite Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

UNIQUE-ID - Menaquinones
TYPES - CPD-11501
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/
/The reduced form of menaquinone is called |FRAME: Menaquinols|.

COMMENT - Retinoic acids comprise a biologically active form of retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives). The spatiotemporal gradient of RA is essential for the regulation of cell proliferation and the differentiation and organ development.
/
/There are three stereoisomeric forms of retinoic acid: |FRAME: RETINOATE|, |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and |FRAME: CPD-13548|, which show different binding affinities to the retinoic acid receptors. 
/
/|FRAME: RETINOATE| is known to bind exclusively to  the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), whereas |FRAME: CPD-13549| binds to both RARs and  retinoid x-receptors (RXRs). |FRAME: CPD-13548| is naturally generated in the body, yet it has a 100-fold lower affinity to RARs than |FRAME: RETINOATE| or |FRAME: CPD-13549|, and it does not bind to RXRs.

/Retinal is a polyene chromophore, and bound to proteins called opsins, is the chemical basis of animal vision. Bound to proteins called |FRAME: Bacteriorhodopsins bacteriorhodopsins|, retinal allows certain microorganisms to convert light into metabolic energy.
/
/Carnivorous vertebrate animals obtain retinal directly from dietary meat. Vegetarian animals produce retinal from one of four carotenoids: |FRAME: CPD1F-129|, |FRAME: CPD1F-118|, |FRAME: CPD1F-126|, and |FRAME: CPD-7409|, which they must obtain from plants or other photosynthetic organisms.
/
/Invertebrates such as insects and squid use hydroxylated forms of retinal in their visual systems, which they derive from  from other xanthophylls.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Chlorophylls
TYPES - Chlorins
COMMON-NAME - a chlorophyll
COMMENT - Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.
/The name is derived from Greek (chloros "green" and phyllon "leaf".
/Chlorophyll absorbs light strongly in the blue and red spectra and has a strong green color.
/Chlorophylls play a crucial role in photosynthesis, both in the antennae and in the reaction centers.
/By far most of the chlorophylls are found in the antennae, where they absorb light and transfer that light
/energy by resonance energy transfer to the reaction center.
/Some of the cholorophylls (known as P700 and P680) are part of the photosystems reaction centers,
/where they perform the charge separation reaction, sending electrons to a transfer chain that ultimately
/results in the reduction of |FRAME: NADP| to |FRAME: NADPH|.

COMMENT - Galactolipids are the main lipids of the membranes of chloroplasts and photosynthetic microorganisms. The main galactolipids in these membranes are |FRAME: D-Galactosyl-12-diacyl-glycerols| (MGDG) and |FRAME: Galactosyl-galactosyl-diacyl-glycerols| (DGDG). These compounds have been found in the X-ray structures of photosynthetic complexes, and are believed to assume a direct role in photosynthesis |CITS: [11906834]|.
/
/The galactolipids |FRAME: D-galactosylceramide galactocerebrosides| and |FRAME: GALACTOSYLCERAMIDE-SULFATE "galactocerebrosides 3-sulfate"| are abundant components in myelin, the membrane around the axons in the nervous system of vertebrates |CITS: [9530920]|.
/
/In addition, some galactolipids act as secondary metabolites and herbivore deterrents in plants and algae |CITS: [1408943][11999395][12684854]|.

COMMON-NAME - a sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol
COMMENT - |FRAME: SULFOQUINOVOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL "Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol"| (SQDG) is an abundant class of sulfolipids composed of a glycoside of |FRAME: CPD-10247| and |FRAME: 1-2-Diglycerides diacylglycerol|, which are found in many photosynthetic organisms, including all photosynthetic plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and purple sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria.
/
/SQDG  is synthesized from |FRAME: UDP-SULFOQUINOVOSE| by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.M2|. The synthesis of SQDG is not crucial under normal growth conditions. It only becomes important when phosphate is limited |CITS: [9465123]|. Under such conditions, the increase of SQDG levels compensates for the decrease in phospholipids and ensures a constant proportion of anionic lipids in photosynthetic membranes |CITS:[14675442]|.
/
/SQDG is localized in photosynthetic membranes (in plants in the thylakoid membranes), where it is closely associated with certain membrane proteins.

COMMENT - Gibberellins (GAs) are plant hormones that regulate growth and influence various developmental processes, including stem elongation, germination, dormancy, flowering, sex expression, enzyme induction, and leaf and fruit senescence.
/
/All known gibberellins are diterpenoid acids that are synthesized by the terpenoid pathway in plastids and then modified in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol until they reach their biologically-active form (see |FRAME: PWY-5052|). The gibberellins are named GA1 through GAn in order of discovery.
/
/All gibberellins have either 19 or 20 carbon units grouped into either four or five ring systems (see |FRAME: CPD1F-95| and |FRAME: CPD1F-134|, respectively).  The fifth ring is a lactone ring.  GAs containing a tetracyclic <i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME: CPD1F-95|) are called C<sub>20</sub>-GAs, whereas GAs containing a pentacyclic 20-nor-<i>ent</i>-gibberellane structure (|FRAME: CPD1F-134|) are called C<sub>19</sub>-GAs.

/The real purpose of strigolactones, which was understood 40 years after the discovery of strigol, is to promote the formation of symbiotic associations known as arbuscular mycorrhiza, which consist of close interaction between the plants roots and |FRAME: TAX-214504| fungi |CITS: [15944706][16574693]|. Arbuscular mycorrhiza, which are found in more than 80% of higher plant species, are one of the most ancient symbioses of land plants. The fungi acquire and deliver nutrients to the plants, which in return provides the fungi with carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis |CITS: [15944687]|.
/
/The lactones induce extensive hyphal branching in germinating spores of the fungi, which increases the chance of contact with the root and subsequently infecting it. The branching phenomenon has been known for more than 30 years before the identity of the chemical signal that promotes it has been traced to strigolactone |CITS: [Mosse73]|.
/
/Since strigolactones are very labile and active at concentrations as low as picomolar, they are active only in close proximity to potential host roots, ensuring successful interactionbetween the fungi the roots.
/
/Study of mutants lacking strigolactones suggest that the hormones are also involved in the regulation of shoot branching, acting as branch-inhibiting hormones |CITS: [15268852][15342640]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Ginsenosides Ginsenosides| or panaxosides are a class of steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins found exclusively in the plant genus |FRAME: TAX-4053| (ginseng). They are the principal components responsible for the pharmaceutical activities of ginseng.
/
/Ginsenosides are composed of an aglycone and sugar moieties. Based on the structure of their aglycones, ginsenosides have been categorized into three broad types; |FRAME: Protopanaxadiol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides"| (PPD), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 20, |FRAME: Protopanaxatriol-type-ginsenosides "protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides"| (PPT), which contain hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 6 and 20, and |FRAME: Oleanonic-acid-type-ginsenosides "oleanonic-acid-type saponins"|.
/
/Although ginsenosides only have three kinds of aglycones, more than 60 kinds of ginsenosides have been identified by now due to the variability in the type of sugar moieties, their number, and the carbon positions they link to.
/
/The biological activity of ginsenoside increases with the decrease of the number of the sugar moieties. All of the ginsenosides found in large quantities in wild ginseng (known as major ginsenosides) are heavily glycosylated, while the more active less-glycosylated ginsenosides are found in much smalller quantities (and are commonly referred to as the

TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a lipopolysaccharide
COMMENT - This compound class stands for generic and unspecified lipopolysaccharides.
/Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/
/Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; core oligosaccharide, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negatives, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the side chains are variable in structure and toxicity.
/
/The core polysaccharide usually consists of about 20-40 repeated subunits.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

UNIQUE-ID - Two-Electrons-Acceptors

COMMON-NAME - an unknown two electrons acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

UNIQUE-ID - Lignins
TYPES - Aromatic-Polymers
COMMON-NAME - a lignin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Lignins Lignin| is a complex phenolic biopolymer and an integral part of the secondary cell walls of plants and some algae. It is one of the most abundant organic polymers on Earth, exceeded only by |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, and constitutes from a quarter to a third of the dry mass of wood.
/
/During the formation of the secondary cell wall, lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between the |FRAME: CELLULOSE|, |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|, and |FRAME: Pectin pectin| components, driving out water and strengthening the wall.
/
/Lignin is heterogeneous, and lacks a defined primary structure. The main basic monomers (known as monolignols) are the phenylpropanoids |FRAME: COUMARYL-ALCOHOL|, |FRAME: CONIFERYL-ALCOHOL|, and |FRAME: SINAPYL-ALCOHOL| (see |FRAME: PWY-361|). The composition and relative abundance of the lignols differ among different organisms. The monolignols are glycosylated for the purpose of transport to the lignification zone, but the glucose moiety is removed prior to polymerization (see |FRAME: PWY-83|).
/The biosynthesis of lignin is not well understood. It consists of radical-radical coupling, and is catalyzed by oxidative enzymes (peroxidases and/or laccases). Lignin is covalently linked to the hemicellulose fibers, and thus crosslinks different components of the cell wall, conferring mechanical strengtth.
/
/Lignin can be degraded by certain fungi and bacteria that produce the enzymes |FRAME: MANGANESE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "manganese peroxidase"|, |FRAME: DIARYLPROPANE-PEROXIDASE-RXN "lignin peroxidase"| and |FRAME: CELLOBIOSE-DEHYDROGENASE-ACCEPTOR-RXN "cellobiose dehydrogenase"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Factor-420
TYPES - Coenzymes
COMMON-NAME - a coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>
COMMENT - One of the distinguishing features of methanogenic bacteria is their blue-green fluorescence when irradiated with UV light. This fluorescence is due to F420, a cofactor that was identified on the basis of this feature.
/This compound, named for its intense absorbance at 420 nm, was originally isolated by Cheeseman et al |CITS: [5079072]|, and later identified by Eirich et al as the N-(N-L-lactyl-&gamma;-L-glutamyl)-L-glutamic acid phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphate |CITS: [728375]|.
/
/The F420 biosynthetic pathway produces the intermediate F420-0, which contains no glutamate side chains.
/Glutamates are then added by several enzymes. F420 molecules isolated from different organisms differ in the number of the glutamate molecules in the side chains, as well as the nature of the bond (which could be either &alpha; or &gamma;) |CITS: [12909715][12867481][11717263]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Methanofurans
TYPES - Coenzymes
COMMON-NAME - a methanofuran
COMMENT - Methanofurans are a group of related carbon-carrier cofactors involved in the first step of the methanogenic reduction of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| (see |FRAME: METHANOGENESIS-PWY|). Methanofurans react with |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| to form the carbamate <i>N</i>-carboxymethanofuran, which is reduced to |FRAME: Formyl-methanofurans| by |FRAME: EC-1.2.99.5|.
/
/In addition, the cofactor also participates at a later stage of all methanogenesis pathways. These pathways converge at the compound |FRAME:Me-CoM|, which is then disproportionated into |FRAME: CH4| and |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|; the latter process involves methanofuran (see |FRAME: PWY-5209|).
/
/Methanofuran is also used by methylotrophic bacteria as a coenzyme to oxidize formaldehyde to formate |CITS: [9651254][11532013]|.
/
/Methanofurans are the only cofactors known to contain a furan moiety, although furans have been identified in polyketides and fatty acid derived natural products, and are often formed during the heating or oxidation of carbohydrates |CITS: [12013276]|.
/
/The chemical structure of methanofuran varies among different methanogens. At this time (2014) five variants have been characterized:
/|FRAME: CPD-17181| (from |FRAME: TAX-145262|) |CITS: [1517208]|, |FRAME:CPD-7628| (from |FRAME: TAX-2208|) |CITS: [2883935]|, |FRAME:CPD-7629| (from |FRAME: TAX-2173|) |CITS: [3170480]|, |FRAME: methanofuran-d| (from |FRAME: TAX-2190|) |CITS: [24977328]| and |FRAME: CPD-17182| (from |FRAME: TAX-39152|, |FRAME: TAX-2187| and |FRAME: TAX-155863|) |CITS: [25203397]|.
/
/All methanofurans contain the basic core structure of 4-[<i>N</i>-&gamma;-L-glutamyl-&gamma;-L-glutamyl)-<i>p</i>-(&beta;-aminoethyl)phenoxymethyl]-2-(aminomethyl)furan, but with different attached side chains.

TYPES - ssRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the terminal phosphate group of a CCA motif present at the 3'-end of the tRNA. More specifically, the phosphate is attached to position 5 of the ribose of the terminal adenine ribonucleotide of the tRNA. This covalent attachment is catalyzed by dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/This class encompasses both charged and uncharged tRNA molecules.

UNIQUE-ID - DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE
TYPES - HOLO-CITRATE-LYASE
COMMON-NAME - a [citrate-lyase]
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: DEACETYL-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Form| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

//
UNIQUE-ID - NiFe-hydrogenases
TYPES - Hydrogenases
COMMON-NAME - a [NiFe] hydrogenase
COMMENT - This class of proteins represents any [NiFe] hydrogenase that has been activated.
/
/<b>General Background </b>
/
/Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible interconversion of protons, electrons and  |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE|, resulting in |FRAME:HYDROGEN-MOLECULE| oxidation to two protons or in the reverse direction, molecular hydrogen production by the reduction of protons.
/
/Most hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that contain iron-sulfur clusters. They have been subdivided into two main classes based on the composition of two metal atoms at their active center: [NiFe] hydrogenases and [FeFe] hydrogenases. These two classes are phylogenetically distinct. It should be noted that in some of the [NiFe] hydrogenases one of the Ni-bound cysteine residues is replaced by selenocysteine. Those enzymes are known as [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. The [FeFe] hydrogenases usually have high catalytic activity, but are sensitive to irreversible inactivation by |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE|, more so than [NiFe] hydrogenases. 
/
/While [FeFe] hydrogenases are limited to certain bacteria and a few unicellular eukaryotes, [NiFe] hydrogenases are widespread in both bacteria and archaea |CITS: [20463892]|. 
/
/ [NiFe] hydrogenases are usually heterodimeric proteins, but can be associated with additional subunits.The large subunit contains the [NiFe] catalytic site, while the smaller subunit contains 3 FeS clusters.  These clusters transfer electrons from an external electron donor to the [NiFe] site for reduction of protons |CITS: [20463892]|.
/Many [FeFe]-hydrogenases are monomeric but possess additional domains that contain FeS clusters |CITS: [18500479]|. The catalytic core of [FeFe] hydrogenases is a single domain of about 350 residues that accommodates the active site known as the H cluster.
/
/In addition, a third class of hydrogenases is found in some methanogenic archaea. These enzymes contain only a mononuclear Fe active site and no FeS clusters, and are known as [Fe] hydrogenases.

UNIQUE-ID - Aporhodopsins
TYPES - Opsins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Rhodopsins Rhodopsin| is a biological pigment found in the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light. 
/
/Vertebrate rhodopsin consists of the protein moiety |FRAME: Opsins opsin| (|FRAME: Aporhodopsins <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin|), which is a G protein-coupled receptor, and a reversibly covalently bound cofactor, |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [6342691]|. Insect rhodopsin often contains |FRAME: 3-Hydroxy-11-cis-retinal| |CITS: [Seki98]|. Most insects examined use the |FRAME: CPD-14329 "R enantiomer"| of 3-hydroxyretinal, but the dipteran suborder |FRAME: TAX-480117|, including |FRAME: TAX-7215|, use |FRAME: CPD-14328|. Firefly squid (|FRAME: TAX-6625|) have been found to use |FRAME: CPD-14331| |CITS: [3416013][8639666]|.
/
/The retinal chromophore is connected to the protein via a Schiff base (a double bond between a carbon in the chromophore to a nitrogen in a lysine residue of opsin) |CITS: [Harosi95]|. The structure shown here shows the unmodified L-lysine in <i>apo</i>-rhodopsin.
/
/Isomerization of |FRAME: CPD-881| into |FRAME: RETINAL| by light (while bound to the protein) induces a conformational change in opsin, known as bleaching. The protein goes through several conformations:  
/
/photorhodopsin &rarr; bathorhodopsin &rarr; lumirhodopsin &rarr; metarhodopsin I &rarr; metarhodopsin II
/
/|FRAME: Metarhodopsins-II "Metarhodopsin II"| activates the associated G protein transducin and triggers a second messenger cascade. It is subsequently deactivated in a process that involves phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Vertebrate rhodopsin eventually dissociates into |FRAME: RETINAL| and opsin |CITS: [3006038][2719933][2550422]|, and needs to be regenerated in a reverse process that involves arrestin release, dephosphorylation, and the binding of a newly synthesized molecule of |FRAME: CPD-881| |CITS: [13011282][1386362]|. Invertebrate metarhodopsin, on the other hand, is thermally stable, and rhodopsin regeneration is triggered by the absorption of a second photon |CITS: [3780740][8446607]|.

COMMENT - 
/
/PKS13 is a member of the type I polyketide synthase gene family. Sequence analysis revealed that it contains two non-equivalent phosphopantetheine-binding domains, a ketoacyl synthase domain, an acyl transferase domain, and a thioesterase domain |CITS: [14695899][15653820]|.
/
/PKS13 is involved in the Claisen-type condensation as the final step in the synthesis of mycolic acid in |FRAME: TAX-1773|. The first step of this condensation is the binding of a C52-&alpha;-meroacyl group in  an activated AMP form and a 2-carboxyl-cerotoyl group in its CoA-activated form to an N-terminal [acp] domain and a C-terminal [acp] domain, respectively. The binding reactions are catalyzed by the two  4' phosphopentetheinyl transferase domains.
/
/Following the initial binding, the meroacyl group is transferred from the N-terminal domain to the ketoacyl-synthase (KS) domain in a reaction catalyzed by the acyltransferase domain.
/
/The next step involves the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl group of the trans-keto-meroacyl-moiety by the acidic &alpha;-carbon of the 2-carboxyl-cerotoyl-moiety, resulting in the formation of 3-oxo-C87-trans-mycolate bound to the near C-terminal [acp] domain.

COMMON-NAME - a thioredoxin 2
COMMENT - Several types of thioredoxins were identified in bacteria.
/Thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) was first identified in E. coli.

TYPES - Thioredoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Ferredoxins
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

UNIQUE-ID - Rubredoxins
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a rubredoxin
COMMENT - Rubredoxins are found in some bacteria and archaea. Unlike |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins"|, rubredoxins do not contain inorganic sulfide. Instead they contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>. Rubredoxins participate in electron transfer in biological systems, and transfer a single electron. During the process, the central iron atom changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states.
/
/The reduction potential of a rubredoxin is typically in the range +50 mV to -50 mV.

UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Proteins-Oxidized
TYPES - FeS-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized iron-sulfur protein
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins contain iron atom(s) ligated by inorganic sulfide and/or at least two cysteinyl (Cys) ligands. The main function of the Fe-S active sites is electron transfer, mostly in the range of low oxidation-reduction potentials. 
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur proteins are also known to participate in the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in regulation of gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|. Fe-S active sites are perhaps the most ancient cofactors.
/
/The simplest Fe-S proteins contain a mononuclear thiolate complex [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup>, as it occurs in |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. However, in the great majority of Fe-S proteins the iron is present in clusters, with the iron linked by sulfides.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/As mentioned above, small electron transfer proteins that contain only mononuclear [Fe(Cys)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> complexes are called |FRAME: Rubredoxins rubredoxins|. Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/Many complex Fe-S proteins contain multiple clusters arranged in chains, separated 1 - 1.4 nm apart, which allow electron transfer across considerable distances. Other electron-transferring groups such as heme or flavin may also be present. Examples include the electron transport chains of mitochondrial respiration (|FRAME: EC-1.6.5.3 "complex I"|, |FRAME: EC-1.3.5.1 "complex II"| and |FRAME: EC-1.10.2.2 "complex III"|) and photosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I"|), and enzymes such as |FRAME: EC-1.12.1.2 hydrogenase|, |FRAME: EC-1.18.6.1 nitrogenase| and |FRAME: EC-1.17.1.4 "xanthine dehydrogenase"|.
/
/Some enzymes with |FRAME: CPD-7 "4Fe-4S clusters"| are able to achieve unusual reducing power utilizing hydrolysis of MgATP. In these proteins the [4Fe-4S] cluster is located between two subunits of a protein, each contributing two Cys ligands, and each binding one molecule of ATP which is hydrolyzed during electron transfer. These proteins achieve reductions requiring potential differences of more than 1 V.
/
/It should be noted that in enzymes that utilize Fe-S clusters not for electron transfer but directly in catalysis, such as |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.3 aconitase| and radical SAM enzymes, one of iron atoms is free (rather than ligated to an amino acid) and can bind the substrate directly.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Red-Glutaredoxins
TYPES - Glutaredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced glutaredoxin
COMMENT - Glutaredoxins are small redox proteins of the TRX superfamily using glutathione (GSH) as electron donor.
/Like thioredoxins they reduce intracellular disulfides, but they are much more efficient than thioredoxins in
/catalyzing protein deglutathionylation by reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides |CITS:[12682041]|.
/The glutaredoxins seem to play a major role in oxidative stress responses and iron-sulfur cluster
/assembly .
/
/Glutaredoxins have been divided into three classes - the "classical" dithiol proteins, monothiol proteins,
/and GST-related dithiol proteins.
/The classical dithiol glutaredoxins contain two cysteine residues, usually in a CPYC active-site motif;
/while the monothiol glutaredoxins contain a single cysteine found in a CGFS motif in the active site.
/The third group includes atypical glutaredoxins, which are very similar to glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
/proteins, but incorporate the CPYC motif |CITS: [11898418]|. More recently a fourth group of glutaredoxins
/has been described in higher plants. Proteins in this group include a CCXC or CCXS active-site motif
/|CITS: [17089213]|.
/
/
/Glutaredoxins can use a dithiol mechanism similar to that employed by thioredoxins. However,
/unlike thioredoxins glutaredoxins can utilize the thiols from GSH in solution together with the glutaredoxin
/N-terminal cysteine in a mechanism that is called the monothiol mechanism.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-c
TYPES - Cytochromes
COMMON-NAME - a <i>c</i>-type cytochrome
COMMENT - <i>C</i>-type cytochromes (cytC) are electron-transfer proteins that have one or more |FRAME: HEME_C| groups. They are characterized by the covalent attachment of the heme to the polypeptide chain via two (or rarely one) thioether bonds formed between thiol groups of cysteine residues and vinyl groups of the heme molecule. The two cysteine residues almost always occur in the amino-acid sequence CXXCH |CITS: [10647174]|.
/
/<i>C</i>-type cytochromes possess a wide range of properties and function in a large number of different redox processes. In general, the differences in <i>c</i>-type cytochromes among bacteria are much larger than those among animal species. The use of the term term "<i>c</i>-type cytochromes" was introduced to distinguish this family of diverse proteins from the well-characterized mitochondrial protein, which is often referred to as "cytochrome <i>c</i>".
/
/Bacterial <i>c</i>-type cytochromes function in the electron transport chains of bacteria with many different types of energy metabolism, including phototrophs, methylotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers and the nitrogen-fixers. 
/
/The |FRAME: Cytochromes-c "<i>C</i>-type cytochromes"| have been classified in four classes based on their sequence (reviewed in |CITS: [1646017]|):
/
/|FRAME: Class-I-Cytochromes-C "Class I"| includes the low-spin soluble cytC of mitochondria and bacteria, with the heme-attachment site towards the N-terminus, and the sixth ligand provided by a methionine residue about 40 residues further on towards the C-terminus. Memebers of this class were further subdivided into the five subclasses, IA to IE, which are named long cytochrome <i>c</i>2, mitochondrial cytochrome <i>c</i>, split-a-band cytochromes <i>c</i>, cytochrome <i>c</i>8 and cytochrome <i>c</i>5, respectively .
/
/|FRAME: Class-II-Cytochromes-C "Class II"| includes the high-spin cytochromes <i>c</i>' and various low-spin cytochromes (e.g., Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome <i>c</i>-556). The heme-attachment site is close to the C-terminus and in the low-spin proteins the sixth ligand is a methionine residue close to the N-terminus.
/
/|FRAME: Class-III-Cytochromes-C "Class III"| comprises the low redox potential multiple heme cytochromes <i>c</i>3 and <i>c</i>7, with only around thirty residues of amino acid per heme group.
/
/|FRAME: Class-IV-Cytochromes-C "Class IV"| was created to hold the complex proteins that have other prosthetic groups as well as heme <i>c</i>, such as the flavocytochromes <i>c</i> and the cytochromes <i>cd</i>.

/
/<i>d</i>-Type cytochromes have been described in complexes that contain other types of cytochromes. Cytochrome <i>bd</i> functions as a terminal oxidase in some bacterial species (such as |FRAME: TAX-659| and |FRAME: TAX-562|), while cytochrome <i>cd</i><sub>1</sub> is found in a common dissimilatory nitrite reductase present in many denitrifying bacteria.

/
/G proteincoupled receptors are found only in eukaryotes, including yeast, choanoflagellates,and animals. When a ligand binds to the GPCR it causes a conformational change that allows it to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). The GPCR can then activate an associated heterotrimeric G-protein (|FRAME: EC-3.6.5.1 "EC 3.6.5.1"|) by exchanging its bound GDP for a GTP. The G protein's &alpha; subunit, together with the bound GTP, dissociates from the &beta; and &gamma; subunits and interact with either intracellular signaling proteins or directly with functional proteins, depending on the &alpha; subunit type.

UNIQUE-ID - NRPS-PCP-Proteins

COMMON-NAME - an NRPS containing a [peptidyl-carrier-protein] domain
COMMENT - Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are typically polyfunctional modular megasynthases found mainly in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, and participate in assembly line biosynthesis of peptide-based natural products, such as the antibiotic |FRAME: CPD-12245| and the siderophore |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN|.
/The minimal NRPS module consists of condensation, adenylation, and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains.
/
/The adenylation domain recognizes and activates the amino acid substrate through the formation of an aminoacyl adenylate, followed by covalent binding of the activated amino acid as a thioester to the |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| of the PCP domain. The condensation domain catalyzes peptide-bond formation between 2 adjacent modules by facilitating the attack of an upstream peptidyl-PCP donor by a downstream chain-elongation unit, an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor nucleophile.
/
/PCPs are not limited to NRPSs. For example, D-alanyl carrier protein (Dcp) is a discrete PCP that contributes to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and is required for the formation of D-alanyl-lipoteichoic acid |CITS: [18059524]|.

COMMENT - Plasma retinol-binding protein (RBPs) and cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) are specific carriers of the alcohol form of vitamin A (retinol) in body fluids and within the cell, respectively.
/The sequestration of retinol inside a high-affinity binding-protein draws retinol into the cell and protects it from unfettered metabolism, while still allowing the formation of retinyl esters |CITS: [9932510][7683727]|. LRAT, the enzyme that forms retinyl-esters, can access retinol when it is bound to CRBP1 |CITS: [3198596][3178828]|.
/
/The CRBPs are monomeric proteins of approximately 15.5 kDa belonging to a superfamily of small cytoplasmic proteins that specifically interact with hydrophobic ligands. Two such proteins (|FRAME: ENSG00000114115-MONOMER "CRBP I"| and |FRAME: ENSG00000114113-MONOMER "CRBP II"|) with distinct tissue distributions and retinoid-binding properties have been recognized in mammals. 
/
/The human CRBP I is expressed at high levels in many tissues, including ovary, adrenal and pituitary glands, and testis |CITS: [3751963 ]|, while CRBP II is confined essentially to the small intestine. In addition, the Kd of the retinol-CRBP I complex is as low as 0.1 nM |CITS: [7744071]|, whereas the binding of retinol to CRBP II is ~100-fold weaker |CITS: [1995621]|.

COMMENT - The pathways for methanogenesis from methylated C1 compounds follow a similar route. Methyl transfer from the electron acceptor to |FRAME: CoM| is carried out by enzyme systems composed of three polypeptides: a protein that binds a corrinoid prosthetic group |CITS: [9654068]|, and two methyltransferases, named MT1 and MT2. MT1 and the corrinoid protein form a tight heterodimeric complex. When the substrate binds to this complex, MT1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from the substrate to the corrinoid group. MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to 
/|FRAME: CoM| |CITS:[6438059]|. Individual MT1 and corrinoid-binding proteins are highly specific for their respective substrate, and exhibit little or no activity with similar substrates |CITS: [6615129][9195968][9006042][9654067][10852929]|.

/
/The first two proteins, of sizes 52 and 26 kDa, respectively, copurified as a single trimethylamine methyltransferase (TMA-MT). Gel permeation of the TMA-MT fraction demonstrated that the 52- kDa methyltransferase eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa, suggesting a multimeric structure. The 26-kDa corrinoid protein eluted primarily as a monomer, although a small fraction of it eluted with the 280-kDa peak, indicating that the two proteins weakly associate |CITS: [9006042]|.

/The second peptide, MtsB, is a corrinoid protein, similar to the one found in the other systems. Earler studies suggested that one corrinoid cofactor is bound per MtsA:MtsB pair, and six to seven such pairs coprise a 480 kDa complex |CITS: [8335638][8282704]|.

COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that is isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

UNIQUE-ID - 23DHB-EntB
TYPES - ACYL-ACP
COMMON-NAME - a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-[EntB isochorismatase/aryl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - EntB is a bifunctional enzyme that is involved in the |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN| biosynthesis pathway. Enterobactin, a siderophore molecule, is synthesized in response to iron deprivation by formation of an amide bond between |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| (2,3-DHB) and |FRAME: SER|.
/
/EntB is a bifunctional protein that consists of an N-terminal isochorismatase domain and a C-terminal aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain |CITS: [9214294]|. The isochorismatase domain catalyzes the synthesis of |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| from |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE| (|FRAME: EC-3.3.2.1|).
/
/The <i>apo</i>-ArCP domain first undergoes phosphopantetheinylation catalyzed by EntD, turning EntB into the active <i>holo</i>-EntB. The active domain then serves as a substrate for EntE, which activates |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| (formed from |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| by EntA) and attaches it to the ArCP domain of EntB |CITS: [9485415][9214294]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transport-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transport reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - HEME_A
TYPES - Hemes
COMMON-NAME - heme <i>a</i>
COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/Heme <i>a</i> was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-1.9.3.1| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "Heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at ring position 8 is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at ring position 2. It is similar to |FRAME: HEME_O|, which lacks the formyl group but contains the hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain. Both the formyl group and the isoprenoid side chain play important roles in conservation of the energy that is released by oxygen reduction by cytochrome c oxidase.
/
/Heme <i>a</i> is part of |FRAME: A-type-Cytochromes "<i>a</i>-type cytochromes"|. Like in |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|, heme <i>a</i> is often attached to the apoprotein through a coordinate bond between the heme iron and a conserved amino acid side-chain.

/
/The term "heme <i>c</i>" has been used to describe the heme group of cytochromes <i>c</i>. However, the various alternative forms for hemes found in cytochromes <i>c</i> preclude such a simple classification. Note that this generic form does not specify the oxidation state of the iron.

UNIQUE-ID - 6S-Carveols

//
UNIQUE-ID - Inositols
TYPES - Cyclitols
COMMON-NAME - an inositol
COMMENT - Inositol is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential
/compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal
/transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.
/
/Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.
/
/Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.
/
/To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathway (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

UNIQUE-ID - 2-3-Butanediols
TYPES - glycols
COMMON-NAME - a 2,3-butanediol
COMMENT - 2,3-butanediol is of commercial interest, mostly as an antifreeze agent due to to its low freezing point

COMMENT - 1,2-Propanediol (1,2-PDO) occurs in two stereoisomers - |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| and |FRAME: CPD-8891|. Both forms are produced by certain organisms. For example, during the catabolism of 6-deoxyhexoses |CITS: [Suzuki68][16346466]| or during the fermentation of glucose via methylglyoxal |CITS: [Tran-Din85][Cameron86]|. 
/
/1,2-PDO is a bulk industrial chemical with a global demand of around 1.36 million tons/year |CITS: [Shelley07]|. It is widely used in the production of unsaturated polyester resin and as a nontoxic replacement of ethylene glycol in deicer and antifreeze products. Current commercial production of 1,2-PDO is mainly by a synthetic process that results in a racemic mixture.

UNIQUE-ID - Phenylurea-Cytokinins
TYPES - Cytokinins
COMMON-NAME - a phenylurea-type cytokinin
COMMENT - Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones that promote cell division, or cytokinesis, in plant roots and shoots. While their main role is to control cell growth and differentiation, they also affect apical dominance, axillary bud growth, and leaf senescence.
/
/The cytokinins are structurally diverse, and have been divided into two main types: |FRAME: Adenine-Cytokinins "adenine-type cytokinins"| and |FRAME: Phenylurea-Cytokinins "phenylurea-type cytokinins"|. All the natural cytokinins fall into the first type - phenylurea-type cytokinins are synthetic.
/
/The adenine cytokinins are classified further by the configuration of their N6-side chain as isoprenoid or aromatic cytokinins. The most prevalent cytokinins are by far those with an unsaturated isoprenoid side chain, and in particular those with a <i>trans</i>-hydroxylated N6-side chain, such as |FRAME: CPD-4210| and its derivatives.

/
/Most of the adenine-type cytokinins are modified by glucosylation of the adenine ring at the 3-, the 7-, or 9-position and conjugation of alanine at the 9-position of zeatin, forming lupinic acid. With the exception of the 3-glucosides, the <i>N</i>-glucosyl and alanyl conjugates generally exhibit no or low activity.
/
/The most important modifications are those affecting the N6-side chain, where even small substitutions have pronounced effects on cytokinin activity. The most common modifications of the side chain include reduction (e.g. trans-zeatin to dihydrozeatin), conjugation to O-glycosides (O-glucosides and O-xylosides), and side chain cleavage by cytokinin oxidases |CITS: [11337393]|.

/forms.
/
/Only two of the stereoisomers occur naturally:
/|FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium
/within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers
/within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But,
/in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|.
/

UNIQUE-ID - Phenolphthiocerol-B
TYPES - Phenolphthiocerols
COMMON-NAME - a phenol phthiocerol B
COMMENT - |FRAME: Phthiocerols Phthiocerol|-based lipids and glycolipids have been found in many species of |FRAME: TAX-1762|, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-33894|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1777|, |FRAME: TAX-1769| and |FRAME: TAX-1809| |CITS: [3149973]|.
/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.  Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10. 
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/In many organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-1769|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, and |FRAME: TAX-78331|, a phenol group is added at the &omega; end of the molecule |CITS: [3113946]|.
/
/The phenol can be further glycosylated by a type or species-specific mono-, tri-, or a tetrasaccharide. For example, in |FRAME: TAX-78331| the trisaccharide (2,3,4-tri-<i>O</i>-methyl L-fucopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-rhamnopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-2-<i>O</i>-methyl L-rhamnopyranose) is attached.
/
/In addition, the two secondary alcohol functions are often esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"| or |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| (see |FRAME: CPD-18579|) |CITS: [3113946]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Phthiocerols Phthiocerol|-based lipids and glycolipids have been found in many species of |FRAME: TAX-1762|, including |FRAME: TAX-1773|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-33894|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1777|, |FRAME: TAX-1769| and |FRAME: TAX-1809| |CITS: [3149973]|.
/
/Phthiocerols comprise a linear carbohydrate molecule to which one methoxyl group, one methyl group, and two secondary hydroxyl groups are attached.  Two types of phthiocerols have been described. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-A "phthiocerol A"| the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 3 and 4, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 9 and 11. In |FRAME: Phthiocerol-B "phthiocerol B"| a methyl group is missing from the beginning of the molecule, and thus the methoxyl and methyl groups are attached at positions 2 and 3, respectively, and the hydroxyl groups are at positions 8 and 10. 
/
/The two hydroxyl groups serve as attachment points for fatty acids, in a manner analogous to the much more ubiquitous <i>sn</i>-glycerol. The phthiocerol molecules have a range of 28 to 34 carbon atoms in the main chain, indicating a promiscuity of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. Longer molecules have additional carbon atoms added at the &omega; end of the molecule.
/
/In many organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-1769|, |FRAME: TAX-1768|, |FRAME: TAX-1765|, |FRAME: TAX-1781|, and |FRAME: TAX-78331|, a phenol group is added at the &omega; end of the molecule |CITS: [3113946]|.
/
/The phenol can be further glycosylated by a type or species-specific mono-, tri-, or a tetrasaccharide. For example, in |FRAME: TAX-78331| the trisaccharide (2,3,4-tri-<i>O</i>-methyl L-fucopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-rhamnopyranosyl-(&alpha;1&rarr;3)-2-<i>O</i>-methyl L-rhamnopyranose) is attached.
/
/In addition, the two secondary alcohol functions are often esterified by |FRAME: Mycocerosic-Acids "mycocerosic acids"| or |FRAME: Phthioceranic-Acids "phthioceranic acids"| (see |FRAME: CPD-18579|) |CITS: [3113946]|.

TYPES - Sphingomyelins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>N</i>-acyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine
COMMENT - |FRAME: Sphingomyelins Sphingomyelins| are a type of |FRAME: SPHINGOLIPIDS sphingolipids| found in animal cell membranes, especially in the membranous myelin sheath that surrounds some nerve cell axons. It usually consists of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE| and |FRAME: Ceramides|. 
/
/Sphingomyelins are found in all tissues and lipoproteins; for example, they account for ~5% of the lipid phosphate in liver and 25% in pancreas |CITS: [2187537]|. Sphingomyelins have a function in signal transduction |CITS: [8086039]|.  
/
/Sphingomyelins are highly enriched in the plasma membrane of cells, and were considered to be found largely in the exoplasmic leaflet of the cell membrane. However, there is some evidence that there may also be a sphingomyelin pool in the inner leaflet of the membrane |CITS: [2187537]|. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase-2, an enzyme that breaks down sphingomyelins into ceramides, has been found to localize exclusively to the inner leaflet, further suggesting that there may be sphingomyelin present there.
/
/Sphingomyelin can accumulate in a rare hereditary disease called <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=257200">Niemann-Pick Disease</A>. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme sphingomyelinase, rsulting in accumulation of sphingomyelin in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow, and the brain, causing irreversible neurological damage.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-two-electrons-acceptors
TYPES - Two-Electrons-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - an reduced unknown two electrons acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron acceptor is a chemical entity that can accept electrons from another chemical entity.
/By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron acceptors. Different biological electron acceptors differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron acceptors transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).

TYPES - Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an electron-transfer quinone
COMMENT - This class holds |FRAME: Quinones quinones| that are involved in electron transfer within membranes.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinol
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

UNIQUE-ID - Rhodoquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a rhodoquinol
COMMENT - Rhodoquinone (RQ) is a modified ubiquinone, where the methoxyl group in position 3 is replaced by an

/[14285535]|, where is it used for the reduction of fumarate to succinate under anaerobic conditions.
/
/Rhodoquinone is not limited to prokaryotes. It was soon discovered that some eukaryotic parasites such
/as the nematodes |FRAME: TAX-6253| and |FRAME: TAX-6252| |CITS: [5796154][811785]|, as well as
/parasitic helminths |CITS:[4795616]| also contain rhodoquinone, which is essential for fumarate
/reduction under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[2843227]|. Later it was shown that
/rhodoquinone is present in all eukaryotes that reduce fumarate during anoxia, including freshwater
/snails, mussels, lugworms, and oysters |CITS: [8537365]|. The reduced form of rhodoquinone is rhodoquinol.

UNIQUE-ID - Plastoquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a plastoquinol
COMMENT - Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.
/
/Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. Plastoquinone can function as acceptor/donor for one or two electrons. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
/

UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - an ubiquinol
COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures

/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

UNIQUE-ID - Quinones
TYPES - Cyclic-Ketones
COMMON-NAME - a quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/Fatty acids are often classified into four groups by their lengths:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 4-6 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chain of 6-12 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 13-22 carbons.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 23 carbons or longer.
/ 
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

UNIQUE-ID - DsrC-persulfides
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC]-<i>S</i>-sulfanyl-L-cysteine
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.

COMMENT - <i>O</i>-Linked glycans are polysaccharide or oligosaccharide that are linked to a protein via the oxygen atom in the side chain of a |FRAME: SER| or |FRAME: THR| residue. 
/Most commonly O-glycosylation begins with the attachment of |FRAME: CPD-3604| to the free hydroxyl group of the amino acid, although O-linkages to fucose, glucose, mannose, xylose and other sugars are known.
/
/Mucin-type O-glycosylation, consisting of glycans attached via O-linked |FRAME: CPD-3604|, is one of the most abundant forms of protein glycosylation in animals. Eight core-type structures of mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycans have been proposed.
/
/In eukaryotes, <i>O</i>-linked glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus one sugar at a time, while attached to the core protein.
/
/Examples for <i>O</i>-linked glycoproteins include glycophorin, mucin, notch, thrombospondin, |FRAME: Factor-VII "factor VII"| and |FRAME: Factor-IX "factor IX"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycosaminoglycans
TYPES - Glycans
COMMON-NAME - a glycosaminoglycan
COMMENT - Glycosaminoglycans (also known as mucopolysaccharides) are important components of connective tissues. They are composed of long unbranched polysaccharides consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit. The repeating units consist of an <i>N</i>-acetyl-hexosamine and a hexose or hexuronic acid, either or both of which are often sulfated.
/Members of the glycosaminoglycan family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid
/unit they contain (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-12521|, |FRAME: CPD-12515|, galactose, |FRAME:CPD-12557|, |FRAME: CPD-12541|). 
/
/Glycosaminoglycans are divided into four main classes:  |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| and |FRAME: Dermatan-Sulfate|; |FRAME: HEPARIN| and |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate|;  |FRAME: Hyaluronan|; and |FRAME: KERATAN-6-SULFATE|. With the exception of hyaluronan, the polysaccharide chains are linked covalently at the reducing end to a core protein through an <i>O</i>-glycosidic linkage to a serine residue, thus forming proteoglycans.

COMMENT - One of the distinguishing features of methanogenic bacteria is their blue-green
/fluorescence when irradiated with UV light. This fluorescence is due to F420, a cofactor
/that was identified on the basis of this feature.
/This compound, named for its intense absorbance at 420 nm, was originally isolated by Cheeseman et

//
UNIQUE-ID - FeS-Centers
TYPES - Metal-sulfur-Clusters
COMMON-NAME - an iron-sulfur cluster
COMMENT - Iron-sulfur clusters are cofators of |FRAME: FeS-Proteins "iron-sulfur proteins"| and consist of a cluster of two to four iron atoms linked to sulfides, some of which are cysteine residues of the protein.
/
/Several cluster types have been described, including |FRAME: CPD-6|, |FRAME: CPD-23|, |FRAME: 3FE-4S| and |FRAME: CPD-7|. The [3Fe-4S] cluster is relatively rare, and 3Fe/4Fe interconversion may occur with minimal protein reorganization. In another type of Fe-S cluster, known as |FRAME: CPD0-1098|, two of the 4 cysteine residues that are coordinated with the iron atoms in regular |FRAME: CPD-6| are substituted by histidine residues. Although the clusters contain several iron atoms, each one usually transfers only one electron, so, for example, a protein with two [4Fe-4S] clusters will usually transfer two electrons.
/
/Small electron transfer proteins that contain only [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] clusters are called |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|. When Fe-S clusters occur in larger (and sometimes membrane-bound) proteins together with other prosthetic groups and/or metal cofactors, the proteins are designated as complex Fe-S proteins. 
/
/In addition to their roles in electron transfer reactions, iron-sulfur clusters are also known to participate in
/the activation of substrates, the stabilization of radicals and structures, the protection of proteins from enzymes
/and the storage of iron and sulfur. In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.

COMMON-NAME - an uncharged tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the terminal phosphate group of a CCA motif present at the 3'-end of the tRNA. More specifically, the phosphate is attached to position 5 of the ribose of the terminal adenine ribonucleotide of the tRNA. This covalent attachment is catalyzed by dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases |CITS: [10966471]|. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown indicates the phosphate group at the 3'-terminus, to which amino acids are attached.

Further characterization of Trx1 <i>in vitro</i> has shown that it can reduce the disulfides that are formed during catalysis by a range of enzymes, including |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| |CITS: [7016827]| and |FRAME: EG11433-MONOMER "methionine sulfoxide reductase"| (Msr) |CITS: [4392601]|. <i>In vivo</i> experiments with |FRAME: TAX-562| mutant strains have confirmed these observations |CITS: [11544348]|. In addition, thioredoxin 1 can also transfer electrons to  the membrane protein |FRAME: DSBD-MONOMER|, which in turn transfers them to the periplasmic protein disulfide isomerases/oxidoreductases encoded by |FRAME: EG11070| and |FRAME: G6333| |CITS: [12004064]|. 
/
/Trx1 is also required for the assembly of the filamentous |FRAME: TAX-562| phages f1, T7 and M13, though this function is not related to its redox properties |CITS: [3533930]|.

COMMENT - The |FRAME: G-44211| gene of |FRAME: TAX-1892| encodes a 78-amino acid acyl carrier protein that carries |FRAME: CPD-403|, a precursor of all |FRAME: ACTINOMYCIN actinomycin| antibiotics. The gene is located downstream of |FRAME: G-44214|, which encodes a protein that activates the substrate by adenylation.
/
/The |FRAME: G-44211| gene was cloned with a His<sub>6</sub> tag and expressed in |FRAME: TAX-562|, and the recombinant protein was purified |CITS: [10212227]|. Initially only 10% of the recombinant protein was in the <i>holo</i> form. Incubation ofpurified protein with a holo-ACP synthase and coenzyme A resulted in full activation.
/
/Purified |FRAME: MONOMER-19510| (acmA protein) in the presence of ATP acylated the purified <i>holo</i>-AcmD protein with radioactive-|FRAME: 4-TOLUENECARBOXYLATE| (<i>p</i>-toluate), which was used as substrate in place of in natural substrate |FRAME: CPD-403| |CITS: [10212227]|.
/
/Additional experiments showed that <i>p</i>-toluyl-AcmA directly acylated the thioester-bound threonine on |FRAME: MONOMER-19508| (ACMS II), confirming the role of AcmD in transfering activated  |FRAME: CPD-403| to the actinomycin synthase complex |CITS: [10212227]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Apo-AsbD-Proteins
TYPES - Apo-Aryl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an apo-AsbD acyl-carrier protein
COMMENT - AsbD is an aryl-carrier protein that activates |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| prior to its incorporation into |FRAME: CPD-9985|. 
/The AsbD protein itself needs to be activated by the transfer of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| group from |FRAME: CO-A| to serine 40 of the apo form, resulting in the active holo form, in a manner similar to other acyl- and aryl-carrier proteins.
/
/The AsbC protein catalyzes the adenylation of |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|, followed by the transfer of the adenylated intermediate to the holo-asbD protein, resulting in |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| |CITS: [17346033]|.
/
/Once activated, the |FRAME: 3-4-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| moiety can be transferred by AsbE from |FRAME: 34-DHB-AsbD-Proteins| to different receipient molecules, including |FRAME: CPD-11479|, |FRAME: CPD-11480| and |FRAME: CPD-11481| |CITS: [18758617]|.

MT2 then transfers the methyl group from the corrinoid to

/
/The first two proteins, of sizes 52 and 26 kDa, respectively, copurified as a single trimethylamine methyltransferase (TMA-MT). Gel permeation of the TMA-MT fraction demonstrated that the 52- kDa methyltransferase eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 280 kDa, suggesting a multimeric structure. The 26-kDa corrinoid protein eluted primarily as a monomer, although a small fraction of it eluted with the 280-kDa peak, indicating that the two proteins weakly associate |CITS: [9006042]|.

COMMENT - Flavodoxin (Fld) is a soluble electron shuttle flavoprotein (it binds a |FRAME: FMN "flavin mononucleotide"|) that is isofunctional with ferredoxin (Fd). In photosynthetic organisms flavodoxin is reduced by the terminal electron acceptors of |FRAME: CPLX490-3509|.
/
/Fd and Fld are involved in multiple redox reactions. They can both sustain cyclic as well as linear electron flow. The cyclic electron flow creates a proton gradient across the photosynthetic membrane and allows ATP synthesis independent of photosystem II activity. Linear electron flow, on the other hand, utilizes electrons from the reduced Fd and Fld for NADP+
/reduction in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: SYNPCC7942_0978-MONOMER| (FNR). The source of electrons during linear electron flow is the dissociation of water by |FRAME: CPLX490-3506|.
/
/Fd serves also as an electron donor to a number of soluble enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism, sulfur metabolism and the regulation of carbon metabolism. Fld can substitute Fd under conditions of iron deprivation in most cyanobacteria and some algae and may be efficient in reducing most or all of these soluble enzymes |CITS: [11687213]|.

/
/Unlike the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-14393| ((6Z)-hexadec-6-enoate|) which is derived from |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs palmitoyl-[acp]| in a single step catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.26| (see |FRAME: PWY-5362|), the biosynthesis |FRAME: CPD-8477| involves both desaturation and elongation steps.

COMMENT - This class contains an acyl carrier protein holoenzyme domain of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase bound to
/the pentapeptide shown here.  This domain is also known as a thiolation domain, or a peptidyl carrier protein domain.
/
/This chemical structure is modified from |CITS: [16195555]|.  The holo-acyl carrier protein (holo-[acp]) is represented
/here as a superatom.  The synonym for this structure was named using the IUPAC name generator (Preferred
/IUPAC Name) in MarvinSketch version 5.0 from ChemAxon.  Note that these names do not take into account the
/thioester linkage between the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the holo-acyl carrier protein and the amino acid.

COMMON-NAME - a flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

COMMON-NAME - a dolichol
COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit |CITS: [9363431][21091511]|.
/
/The length of dolichol molecules varies within a range in a species, and the range varies among species (reviewed in |CITS: [9878760]|). In mammals dolichols are usually within the range of 80 to 105 carbons. Archaebacteria prefer dolichols of 55-60 carbons.
/
/The main function of dolychols is to act as a membrane anchor for the formation of oligosaccharides, which are then transferred to certain asparagine residues within proteins through a modification process known as |FRAME: MANNOSYL-CHITO-DOLICHOL-BIOSYNTHESIS "N-glycosylation"|. In eukaryotes dolichol is also involved in the transfer of some of the monosaccharides to the forming oligosaccharide.
/
/Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra |FRAME: CPD-12419| |CITS: [15686500]|.
/
/The structure shown here is of a C80 dolichol, containing 16 isoprene units.

UNIQUE-ID - Ubiquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a ubiquinone
COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

UNIQUE-ID - Demethylmenaquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a demethylmenaquinone
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rhodoquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a rhodoquinone
COMMENT - Rhodoquinone (RQ) is a modified ubiquinone, where the methoxyl group in position 3 is replaced by an
/amino group. The compound was originally isolated from |FRAME:TAX-1085| |CITS:[Glover62][14293762]
/[14285535]|, where is it used for the reduction of fumarate to succinate under anaerobic conditions.
/
/Rhodoquinone is not limited to prokaryotes. It was soon discovered that some eukaryotic parasites such
/as the nematodes |FRAME: TAX-6253| and |FRAME: TAX-6252| |CITS: [5796154][811785]|, as well as
/parasitic helminths |CITS:[4795616]| also contain rhodoquinone, which is essential for fumarate
/reduction under anaerobic conditions |CITS:[2843227]|. Later it was shown that
/rhodoquinone is present in all eukaryotes that reduce fumarate during anoxia, including freshwater
/snails, mussels, lugworms, and oysters |CITS: [8537365]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - PLASTOQUINONE
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a plastoquinone
COMMENT - |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE Plastoquinones| (PQ) are benzoquinone electron carriers that can function as acceptor/donor for either one or two electrons. They are analogs of |FRAME: Ubiquinones "ubiquinones"| (Coenzyme Q), with two methyl groups substituting the methoxy groups found in Q. The fully reduced form is called |FRAME: Plastoquinols|.
/
/Plastoquinones are found in the chloroplasts of higher plants, red, brown and green algae, and in cyanobacteria, and are important members of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, where they carry electrons from |FRAME: CPLX490-3506| to the |FRAME: CPLX-9022|. In fact, it has been shown that in cyanobacteria essentially all electron transport through unbound quinones proceeds via PQ in cyanobacterial thylakoids. Apart from PQ the only quinone found in thylakoids is vitamin K1, which is associated with PS I |CITS: [Vermaas01]|.
/
/Plastoquinones also serve as cofactors involved in the desaturation of phytoene in the synthesis of carotenoids (see |FRAME: PWY-6475|).
/
/Plastoquinone was isolated originally in 1946 from alfalfa, but was not identified at the time. It was rediscovered in 1959 and its structure was described in the same year (see |CITS: [7022156]|).
/
/Please note that tyhe structure shown here is that of |FRAME: PLASTOQUINONE-9| and is not accurate for this generic class of compounds, which contains plastoquinones with different side-chain lengths.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Anthraquinones
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - an anthraquinone
COMMENT - Anthraquinone derivatives are found in microorganisms, fungi, plants, marine organisms, and insects. In higher plants, most anthraquinones occur as mono- or diglycosides. The yellow or red colored compounds have some commercial relevance as natural dyes. 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones serve as laxatives.
/
/In fungi and some higher plants (Leguminosae, Rhamnaceae, Polygonaceae, and Caesalpiniaceae), anthraquinones are biosynthesized via a polyketide pathway which comprises the successive condensation of acetyl CoA with 7 molecules of malonyl CoA to form an octa-&alpha;-keto-acyl chain, which is converted to the anthraquinone system via decarboxylation, cyclization, and aromatization.

Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - Ibuprofen
TYPES - Monocarboxylates

COMMENT - Ibuprofen is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, fever reduction, and against swelling.
/Like other NSAID drugs (e.g. |FRAME: CPD-524| and |FRAME: CPD-7669|), ibuprofen works by inhibiting the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.99.1| (also known as cyclooxygenase or COX) that converts |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| to |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2|, a precursor to other prostaglandins that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever. In addition, |FRAME: PROSTAGLANDIN-H2| is also a precursor of |FRAME: ALPHA11-ALPHA-EPOXY-15-HYDROXYTHROMBA|, which stimulates platelet aggregation. The inhibition of the COX1 variant of the COX cyclooxygenase also reduces the formation of blood clots.
/Ibuprofen inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, |FRAME: HS01815| (COX1) and |FRAME: HS01115| (COX2).
/
/Ibuprofen was derived from |FRAME: PROPIONATE| during the 1960s. Originally marketed as Brufen, ibuprofen is available under a variety of popular trademarks, including Motrin, Nurofen, Advil, Nuprin and many others.
/
/The active form of ibuprofen is |FRAME: CPD-15516|. The drug is synthesized as a racemic mixture, but an isomerase encoded by the |FRAME: HS01416| gene converts the inactive |FRAME: CPD-15517 "(R)-form"| <i>in vivo</i> to the active form via a coenzyme A derivative |CITS: [9106621]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/
/The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein "lipoyl domain"|, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain (producing |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|), and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-782|, resulting in |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine|.
/

COMMON-NAME - a [DsrC protein]-dithiol
COMMENT - The dissimilatory sulfite reductase, DsrAB, is an essential enzyme in prokaryotic sulfur-based energy metabolism. In sulfur reducers it catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, while in sulfur oxidizers it catalyzes the opposite reaction |CITS: [Schedel79]|. This reaction involves the small protein DsrC, which is present in all organisms that contain DsrAB, including sulfate/sulfite reducing organisms, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, and organosulfonate reducers.
/
/DsrC contains two redox-active conserved cysteines in a flexible C-terminal arm. A crystal structure of |FRAME: TAX-881| DsrAB in complex with DsrC has shown that the C-terminal arm of DsrC projects inside DsrAB in a way that brings its last Cys (CysA) right next to the active site. 
/
/In |FRAME: TAX-1049| DsrC is the final sulfur-accepting protein, receiving the sulfur from the sulfur-carrier protein |FRAME: DsrE-Protein DsrE| and forming |FRAME: DsrC-persulfides "a perthiol on CysA"|. This perthiol serves as a direct substrate for |FRAME: CPLX-7133| (DsrAB), which catalyzes the oxidation of the sulfane sulfur while still attached to DsrC. The oxidized sulfur is then released is the form of sulfite, leaving DsrC with |FRAME: DsrC-disulfide-form "an intramolecular disulfide bond"| between the two cysteine residues |CITS: [18656485]|. This disulfide bond can be dissociated by the action of the DsrK protein, part of the DsrMKJOP complex |CITS: [20952577]|.
/
/In sulfite reducing bacteria, where the reaction occurs in the opposite direction, the two substrates for DsrAB are DsrC and a sulfite molecule. During the reaction the sulfite sulfur is added to CysA of DsrC and reduced, forming a perthiol. The sulfur then leaves as a sulfide, leaving DsrC with intramolecular disulfide bond between the two cysteine residues as described above |CITS: [24662917]|.
/
/In the structure shown below, the R residue represents a stretch of amino acids that separate the two conserved L-cysteines.

/
/|FRAME: Mitogen-Activated-Protein-Kinase "Mitogen-activated protein kinases"| (MAP kinase or MAPK) are eukaryotic protein kinases that are specific to the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. They are found in all eukaryotes including unicellular eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals.
/
/MAP kinases are involved in directing cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli, such as mitogens, osmotic stress, heat shock and proinflammatory cytokines. They regulate cell functions including proliferation, gene expression, differentiation, mitosis, cell survival, and apoptosis |CITS: [11294822]|.
/
/MAP kinases are catalytically inactive in their base form. In order to be active, they need to be phosphorylated. Most of the MAP kinases belong to the "classical MAP kinases" family and need to be phosphorylated on two amino acids, a threonine and a tyrosine, which are found in a TxY motif at the activation loop. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine precedes phosphorylation of the threonine. Some MAP kinases are atypical and require only a single residue in their activation loops to be phosphorylated.
/
/|FRAME: MAP-kinase-MEK "Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase"| (also known as MAP2K, MEK, MAPKK) is the enzyme that phosphorylates MAP kinases. In humans there are seven genes encoding MAP2K enzymes. MAP2K enzyme also need to be activated by phosphorylation prior to becoming active. The activation is carried out by the serine/threonine protein kinase MAP kinase kinase kinase ( MAP3K or MEKK).

COMMENT - <i>O</i>-antigens are part of |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|. Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (lipid A), a core polysaccharide, and polysaccharide (<i>O</i>) side chains.
/
/The side chain is referred to as an <i>O</i>-antigen. The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of repeating oligosaccharide subunits made up of three to five sugars. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.
/
/The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered rough or smooth. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the O-antigen, in addition to the "smoothness" of the strain.

UNIQUE-ID - Hemicelluloses
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - hemicellulose
COMMENT - Please note that hemicellulose is a not a precise biological term.
/
/The plant cell wall is composed of |FRAME: CELLULOSE| and many additional complex polymers.
/Unlike cellulose, which is crystalline and resistant to hydrolysis, the other polymers are amorphous and are easily hydrolyzed by dilute acid or base.
/
/Hemicellulose is a heterogeneous term that is used for all the plant cell wall components that are soluble in dilute alkali solutions, or that go into solution quite readily in hot dilute mineral acids with the formation of simple sugars. The term is often used to describe all the polysaccharide components of the cell wall other than cellulose.
/
/Hemicelluloses constitute about one-fourth of perennial plants and about one-third of annual plants. Since the term does not refer to a particular chemical entity, hemicelluloses extracted from different plant sources are rarely identical. 
/However, D-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses of most woods and annual plants. D-xylose occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Xylans|, as derivatives of xylan, such as |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan| and |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, and as side chains on other types of backbones, such as |FRAME: Xyloglucan xyloglucan| and |FRAME: Xylogalacturonan xylogalacturonan|.
/D-Mannose is also very abundant, and occurs as the polymer |FRAME: Mannan mannan| or in combination with D-glucose or D-galactose as |FRAME: Glucomannans glucomannans|, |FRAME: Galactomannans galactomannan|, or |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannan|. Arabinose is common as well, either in the form of |FRAME: Arabinans "L-arabinan"| or in the form of side chains on other polysaccharides.
/
/Other sugars common in hemicellulose include |FRAME: Galactose galactose|, |FRAME: Rhamnose rhamnose|, |FRAME: Galacturonate galacturonate| and |FRAME: Mannuronate mannuronate|.
/
/Hemicellulose consists of shorter chains than cellulose, typically 500 - 3,000 sugar units, and is usually branched.

COMMENT - <i>O</i>-Linked glycans are polysaccharide or oligosaccharide that are linked to a protein via the oxygen atom in the side chain of a |FRAME: SER| or |FRAME: THR| residue. 
/Most commonly O-glycosylation begins with the attachment of |FRAME: CPD-3604| to the free hydroxyl group of the amino acid, although O-linkages to fucose, glucose, mannose, xylose and other sugars are known.
/
/Mucin-type O-glycosylation, consisting of glycans attached via O-linked |FRAME: CPD-3604|, is one of the most abundant forms of protein glycosylation in animals. Eight core-type structures of mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycans have been proposed.
/
/In the structure below, R1 is hydrogen when the modified amino acid is |FRAME: SER| and carbon when the amino acid is |FRAME: THR|. 
/
/In eukaryotes, <i>O</i>-linked glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus one sugar at a time, while attached to the core protein. 
/
/Examples for <i>O</i>-linked glycoproteins include glycophorin, |FRAME: Mucin mucin|, notch, thrombospondin, |FRAME: Factor-VII "factor VII"| and |FRAME: Factor-IX "factor IX"|.

/a hydroxyl on its 5' end. tRNA ligase then opens the 2',3' cyclic phosphate to a 2'-phosphate, phosphorylates the hydroxyl on the 3' half-molecule and joins the two halfmolecules to leave a mature length tRNA with a 2'-phosphate at the splice junction.

UNIQUE-ID - tRNA-Sec
TYPES - tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>sec</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Reduced-ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced 2[4Fe-4s] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>- pattern. This pattern is duplicated in ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters.

/
/Adrenodoxin receives the electrons from NADPH through a special protein, |FRAME: EC-1.18.1.6|. The three proteins - adrenoredoxin, adrenoredoxin reductase, and the hydroxylase, form a ternary complex.

UNIQUE-ID - Cytochromes-CL-Red
TYPES - Cytochromes-C-Reduced
TYPES - Cytochromes-CL
COMMON-NAME - a reduced cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub>
COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub> is a relatively large (about 19 kDa) acidic cytochrome that is specifically involved in electron transfer from the quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase |CITS: [6263253][6295363]|.
/Despite its relatively large size it contains only one heme. Its amino acid suggests that it is completely different, except for its heme-binding site, from all other cytochromes |CITS: [2851998]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c</i><sub>L</sub> has been cloned and studied from several methylotrophic bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-272630| |CITS: [3129405][2842733]| and |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [1657871]|.

UNIQUE-ID - UDP-NAcMur-Tetrapeptides
TYPES - UDP-sugar
COMMON-NAME - a UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylmuramoyl-tetrapeptide
COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation. The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599][5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).

/In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of
/<i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as

COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

/
/"Corrinoid proteins" are proteins that bind corrinoid cofactors. The most common corrinoid proteins are methyltransferases and reductive dehalogenases |CITS: [8631705][8932317][11976751][17142327]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - PENICILLIN
TYPES - Penams
COMMON-NAME - a penicillin
COMMENT - Penicillins are medically important |FRAME: Beta-Lactams "&beta;-lactam"| antibiotics biosynthesized as end products by certain filamentous fungi, including |FRAME: TAX-5076| and |FRAME: TAX-162425|.
/
/&Beta;-Lactam antibiotics inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall by the irreversible binding of their four-membered &beta;-lactam ring to the so-called |FRAME: Penicillin-Binding-Proteins "penicillin binding proteins"| (PBPs).
/The PBPs are proteins that contain a D,D-peptidase domain, most commonly used for hydrolyzing the |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| bond found in the pentapetide moiety of peptidoglycans. Since the &beta;-lactam moiety of |FRAME: PENICILLIN "penicillins"| is similar to the D-Ala-D-Ala structure, these enzymes bind penicillin irreversibly and become inactive.
/Several groups of enzymes belong to this family - carboxypeptidases, transpeptidases, and endopeptidases. The carboxypeptidase remove the terminal |FRAME: D-ALANINE| from the pentapeptide, the transpeptidase form crosslinks between the pentapeptides of adjacent glycan threads, and the endopeptidases hydrolyze these crosslinks.
/This irrevesible binding prevents the enzyme from catalyzing the formation of these cross-links, resulting in a defective cell wall and cell death.
/
/Penicillin antibiotics were the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases, such as syphilis, and infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today, although more and more types of bacteria have acquired resistance.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Cephalosporins

UNIQUE-ID - Kanamycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a kanamycin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Kanamycins Kanamycins| are a group of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1967|. The compounds were discovered in 1957 by researchers in the National Institute of Health of Tokyo, Japan |CITS: [13513509][13595489]|. Due to their wide range of activity, especially against severe staphylococcal and mycobacterial infections, these antibiotics gained almost immediate acceptance, and the most common form, |FRAME: CPD-4821|, was produced commercially within a year of its discovery |CITS: [13566481]|.
/
/Kanamycins interact with the 30S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, inducing substantial amounts of mistranslation and indirectly inhibiting translocation during protein synthesis, resulting in death |CITS: [391568][9662506]|. Kanamycins are currently used to treat a wide variety of infections.
/
/Kanamycins share several biosynthetic intermediates with other aminoglycosides, including the core moiety |FRAME: CPD-10151| and the pseudodisaccharides |FRAME: CPD-14126|, |FRAME: CPD-14125| and |FRAME: CPD-14137|.
/
/While the main product produced by |FRAME: TAX-1967| is |FRAME: CPD-4821| (R1 = NH2; R2 = OH), additional products are also produced, including |FRAME: CPD-4822| (R1 = R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>), |FRAME: CPD-4823| (R1 = OH; R2 = NH<sub>2</sub>) |CITS: [13563334][13587408]|, |FRAME: CPD-14138| (similar to |FRAME: CPD-4821|, but contains a glucose moiety instead of the kinosamine moiety) |CITS: [Adams96]| and |FRAME: CPD-4824| (R1 = R2 = OH) |CITS: [Chang80]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Neomycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a neomycin
COMMENT - Neomycins are a family of broad-spectrum highly toxic antibiotics produced by |FRAME: TAX-1906|. They were discovered in 1949 by Waksman and Lechevalier (Waksman later received the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physiology and medicine) |CITS: [17782716]|.
/
/Neomycin usually exists as a complex composed of two stereoisomers, |FRAME: CPD-14142| and |FRAME: CPD-14141|, which are the two active components. A third component, |FRAME: CPD-14137 "neomycin A"|, which is a degradation product, is present in small quantities.
/
/Neomycin was originally used as a treatment for tuberculosis, but serious side effects soon became apparent, including ototoxicity |CITS: [8170691]|, which sometimes developed to complete loss of hearing, and nephrotoxicity. Thus systemic use of neomycin is limited, and the most common mode of use is via topical application |CITS: [6224608]|.

COMMON-NAME - a lividomycin
COMMENT - The lividomycins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycosidic antibiotics"| produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-282216|. The lividomycins were discovered In Japan in the early 70s |CITS: [5091208][5092785][5092786][ 4624613][4647833]|. Like other aminoglucoside antibiotics, it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 16S ribosomal RNA |CITS: [4945812][4586150]|. 
/
/Despite promising initial results against urinary tract infections |CITS: [4579561][4579564][4203572]|, tuberculosis |CITS:[4721804][4142798]| and other respiratory tract infections |CITS: [807755][1041282]|, lividomycin never became widely used.

UNIQUE-ID - Butirosins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a butirosin
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-14140 "Butirosins A"| and |FRAME: CPD-14193| are naturally occurring derivatives of the |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "2-aminoglycoside antibiotics"| |FRAME: CPD-14196| and |FRAME: CPD-14143|, respectively, produced by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1397| and discovered in the early 1970s |CITS: [4207954][4670491][4670492]|.
/
/The butirosins are unique among naturally occurring aminoglycosides since they contain an (<i>S</i>)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side-chain at the C-1 amine of the central 2-deoxystreptamine ring. This modification has been shown to confer resistance against several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (the C-1 amine is a frequent target of aminoglycoside N-acyltransferases). As a result, the butirosins are active toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
/
/Although the butirosins are not themselves clinically useful drugs, the properties of their side-chain have led to successful synthetic alteration of |FRAME: CPD-4822| and |FRAME: CPD-14161| to produce |FRAME: CPD-14197| and |FRAME: CPD-14162|, respectively |CITS: [62814][Watanabe87a]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gentamycins
TYPES - Deoxystreptamine-Antib
COMMON-NAME - a gentamicin
COMMENT - Gentamicins are a family of |FRAME: Aminoglycoside-Antibiotics "aminoglycoside antibiotics"| produced by Gram-positive bacteria of the |FRAME: TAX-1873| genus. They were discovered in 1963 by a group of scientists at the Schering Corporation |CITS: [14274893]|.
/
/Gentamicins are particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria, and are bactericidal. They act by binding the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, interrupting protein synthesis. Despite their high antibacterial activity, intravenous use is limited by their ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, they are used commonly as a topical treatment to skin infections. The most common form of gentamycin is the C complex, which consists of a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-14213|, |FRAME: CPD-14216|, |FRAME: CPD-14211| and |FRAME: CPD-14212|. 
/
/While the name can be written as both gentamicin and gentamycin, the former is more common, to emphasize the biological origin of the antibiotics.

COMMENT - D-Glucose is an extremely abundant monosaccharide that is used as an energy source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans. In humans D-glucose is the key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, but other organisms can also metabolize glucose by anaerobic respiration and fermentation.
/
/D-Glucose is also one of the main products of photosynthesis, and is used as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances, such as cellulose and chitin. Many organisms store glucose as an energy and carbon reserve in the form of plymers such as  starch and glycogen.
/
/In addition, D-glucose is often added onto certain proteins and lipids through glycosylation, which is often critical for their functioning.

Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary.

COMMENT - This compound class describes a linoleoyl group that is incorporated within a lipid molecule.
/
/|FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID Linoleate| (linoleic acid) is an &omega;-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain and two <i>cis</i> double bonds at positions 9 and 12.
/
/Linoleate is produced by many organisms, including bacteria, plants, fungi and some insects. It is abundant in many vegetable oils, especially safflower and sunflower oils. 
/
/While mammals require linoleate, which is found in their membranes and is used as the precursor for production of |FRAME: CPD-8117|, |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID|, |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins|, |FRAME: Leukotrienes leukotrienes|, and |FRAME: Thromboxanes thromboxanes|, they are not able to produce it since they lack |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.6|. Thus linoleate is an essential fatty acid, and must be obtained through the diet.

/fatty acids produced by the fatty acid synthase. It's name is derived from the olive tree, since it makes up 55-80% of olive oil.
/
/Oleate synthesis occurs with membrane-bound systems. The desaturase enzymes that produce oleate have been isolated from fungi, yeast, and mammalian liver and found to be specific for |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|. In plants, on the other hand, oleate is produced via |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs|, an acyl-carrier-protein bound intermediate |CITS: [4831331]|.

UNIQUE-ID - LysW-C-Terminal-L-Glutamate
TYPES - Protein-alpha-L-Glutamates
COMMON-NAME - a [LysW protein]-L-glutamate
COMMENT - LysW is an &alpha;-aminoadipate carrier protein used by many archaebacterial species for the synthesis of the amino acid |FRAME: LYS|. 
/
/The amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, an intermediate in the archaeal L-lysine biosynthetic pathway (which is also found in the hyperthermophilic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-274|), is covalently linked to the &gamma;-carboxyl group of the last C-terminal residue of LysW (Glu54 in |FRAME: TAX-274|) by a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5207| gene. LysW not only protects the amino group of |FRAME: CPD-468|, but also serves as a carrier protein, which is easily recognized by lysine biosynthesis enzymes. In this way all subsequent transformations leading to L-lyine occur when the amino acid is attached to LysW, and the |FRAME: CPD-468| side chain is converted to a C-terminal lysyl side chain in the LysW-conjugated form. Eventually, a dedicated enzyme encoded by the |FRAME: G-5222| gene releases the mature amino acid |CITS: [19620981]|.
/
/It has been shown that at least in |FRAME: TAX-2284| LysW is also used as a carrier protein for |FRAME: GLT| during the biosynthesis of |FRAME: ARG| |CITS: [23434852]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Galactoglucomannans
TYPES - Mannan
COMMON-NAME - a galactoglucomannan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| (GM) and |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannans| (GGM) are the major hemicellulosic components of the secondary cell walls of softwoods, but occur only in minor amounts in the secondary cell walls of hardwoods. Both polymers consist of a bakbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues. GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues and are often branched.
/Both polymers show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/The mannan backbone of GGM from spruce wood consists of galactose, glucose, and mannose in the mole ratio 1 : 8 : 33, and contains segments of more than four mannopyranose residues, interrupted with a segment composed of both mannopyranose and glucopyranose, or two glucopyranose residues. Branches terminated by single galactose residues are attached at positions 2, 3, and 6 of mannose residues and at positions 3 and 6 of glucose residues of the backbone. Many of the mannose residues are acetylated at positions 2 and 3  |CITS: [11128591]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| (GM), along with |FRAME: Galactoglucomannans galactoglucomannans| (GGM), are the major hemicellulosic components of the secondary cell walls of softwoods, but occur only in minor amounts in the secondary cell walls of hardwoods. 
/|FRAME: Glucomannans Glucomannans| consist of a backbone composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues, and are often branched. Unlike GMs, GGM chains are substituted by galactopyranose residues.
/Glucomannans show some variations in structural features depending on the plant species and stage of plant development |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/Low-molecular-weight GMs, acetylated at position 2 or 3 of some mannopyranose residues, were isolated from aspen and birch wood |CITS: [12668108]|. 
/Soluble, often partially acetylated GMs occur as constituents of bulbs, tubers, seeds, roots, and leaves of some non-gramineousmonocotyl plants. An example are the GMs from plants of the genus |FRAME: TAX-25641|, which are known for their medicinal value. A GM from the potato-like plant |FRAME: TAX-78372| is known as konjac mannan in Japanese food applications.
/Studies of konjac mannan showed that is is branched (8%), with branches joined through the C-6 position of only the glucose residues. Both glucopyranose and mannopyranose residues (in the ratio of 1 : 2) were suggested to terminate the branches |CITS: [Katsuraya03]|.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Galactomannans
TYPES - Mannan
COMMON-NAME - a galactomannan
COMMENT - Mannans are polymers composed of &beta;(1&rarr;4)-linked |FRAME: MANNOSE| residues. Pure mannans are rarely found, and most contain &alpha;(1,6)-linked galactopyranosyl side chains.
/
/The extent of galactosylation varies greatly, and the mannose : galactose ratio is one of the main characteristics of the polymer as it determines their physicochemical properties, such as solubility in water, density, and the viscosity of the solution |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|. On one hand, slightly galactosylated linear mannans (about 4% galactose), have been isolated from the seed endosperm of vegetable ivory nut (|FRAME: TAX-115507|) and date (|FRAME: TAX-42345|). They are water-insoluble, resemble cellulose in conformation of the individual molecular chains, and occur in cellulose microfibrils of the plant tissues |CITS: [Reid95]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Starch
TYPES - Glucans
COMMON-NAME - starch
COMMENT - Starch combines two polymeric carbohydrates (polysaccharides) called |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-amylose"| and |FRAME: CPD-7043|. |FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| contains up to several thousand &alpha;-glucosyl units linked almost exclusively in linear &alpha;(1->4) linkages, with very few branches of &alpha;(1->6) linkages. In |FRAME: CPD-7043|, on the other hand, branching is common, and occurs approximately every 24-30 glucose monomer units. Amylopectin is one of, if not the largest, biological polymer known and contains from 10<sup>5</sup>10<sup>6</sup> glucose residues |CITS: [9730163]|. Unlike glycogen, the starch branches are concentrated in sections of the amylopectin molecule leading to clusters of chains that allow for indefinite growth of the polysaccharide.
/|FRAME: Alpha-Amyloses "&alpha;-Amylose"| accounts for 30% of starch, while |FRAME: CPD-7043| accounts for the other 70%.
/
/The dense packing of branches at the root of the clusters generates tightly packed glucan chains that are close enough to align and form parallel double helical structures. The helices within a single cluster and neighbouring clusters align and form sections of crystalline structures separated by sections of amorphous material (containing the branches) thereby generating the semi-crystalline nature of amylopectin and of the ensuing starch granule. The crystallized chains become insoluble and typically collapse into a macrogranular solid that is osmotically inert |CITS: [9730163]|.
/
/The enzymes of starch synthesis and mobilization are unable to interact directly with the solid structure, with the exception of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.242 "granule-bound starch synthase"| |CITS: [14502990]|.
/
/The solid semi-crystalline starch and hydrosoluble |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen| define two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide. Glycogen is by far the most widespread form of storage, as it is found in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes. The appearance of semi-crystalline storage polysaccharides appears linked to the requirement of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria to fuel nitrogenase and protect it from oxygen through respiration of large amounts of stored carbon |CITS: [21220783]|.

TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - alginate
COMMENT - |FRAME: ALGINATE Alginate| is a major component of the cell walls of |FRAME: TAX-2870| (brown algae), and can make up to 45% of the total algal material. It is a linear polysaccharide of (1-4)-linked |FRAME: CPD-15205|, with variable amounts of its C-5 epimer |FRAME: CPD-15204| |CITS: [Schmidt26]|. The |FRAME: CPD-15205| (M) and |FRAME: CPD-15204| (G) residues are arranged in homopolymeric regions of M and G blocks, interspaced with regions of alternating structure (MG blocks). The physicochemical properties of alginate depend on both the overall M to G ratio and the relative proportions of the three block types in the chain. G block-rich alginate forms a high-strength gel in presence of divalent cations such as calcium, and is found in more rigid parts of the alga. Alginates rich in M or MG blocks are more flexible. The composition varies among species, and within an organism according to the nature and the age of the tissues as well as to the season and to the growing area. Depending on its composition, alginate can absorb 200300 times its own weight in water, forming a viscous gum.
/
/Historically, alginate extracted from seaweed has had a wide variety of uses. Its unique physical properties enable it to be used as a stabilizer, viscosifier, and gelling agent in the food and beverage, paper and printing, biomaterials,
/and pharmaceutical industries |CITS:[9283015][9393029][11018131][12149954][16183570][20581859][25300542]|. Commercial varieties of alginate are extracted from several species, including the giant kelp |FRAME: TAX-35122|, |FRAME: TAX-52969|, and various types of |FRAME: TAX-33637|.
/
/The alginates formed by brown algae are non-acetylated. An acetylated form of alginate is produced by bacteria that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-286| and |FRAME: TAX-352| genera. The higher the degree of O-acetylation, the higher the viscosity and pseudoplastic rheology of the alginate |CITS: [Skjak-Braek88]|. The biological function of alginates differs between the two genera. In |FRAME: TAX-286| alginate is associated with biofilms, promoting bacterial adherence to target cell walls |CITS: [3155514]|. Alginate production is a major contributing factor in chronic pulmonary infections by |FRAME: TAX-287|, the causative agent of cystic fibrosis |CITS: [3155514]|. Most strains of |FRAME: TAX-287| do not produce alginate, although alginate is always produced in the lung of CF pateints. it is believed that alginate encapsulation protects the infecting bacterial cells from phagocytosis, as well as from antibiotic therapy.

/
/|FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "Plant arabinogalactans"| (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.
/
/AG of type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods.

COMMENT - Arabinogalactans are biopolymers consisting of arabinose and galactose residues. Two main classes of arabinogalactans are found in nature: |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans "plant arabinogalactan"| and |FRAME: Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans "microbial arabinogalactan"|.
/
/The |FRAME: Mycobacterial-Arabinogalactans "microbial arabinogalactan"| consists of arabinose and galactose monosaccharides in their furanose configurations and is a major structural component of the mycobacterial cell wall, where it is covalently attached to the peptidoglycan.
/
/The galactan portion of the polymer is linear, consisting of approximately 30 units with alternating &beta;-(1-5) and
/&beta;-(1-6) glycosidic linkages.
/
/|FRAME: Arabinans Arabinan| chains are attached at three branch points within the galactan chain (believed to be at residues 8, 10 and 12) |CITS: [16040600]|. These chains consist of about 30 residues |CITS: [18303028]|.
/
/The arabinan portion of the polymer is a complex branched structure with glycosidic linkages of &alpha;-(1-3),
/&beta;-(1-5), and &beta;-(1-2).
/
/In the Mycobacterial cell wall, the arabinan portion is usually capped with mycolic acids.

UNIQUE-ID - Xylans
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - xylan
COMMENT - Xylan is a general name given for polysaccharides composed of xylose residues. It is the principal type of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in plant biomass representing the second most abundant polysaccharide in the biosphere after |FRAME: CELLULOSE| |CITS: [20113432]|.
/
/The most common form of xylan is |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan|, which is found in the cell walls of plants and some algae. 
/Pure |FRAME: 1-4-beta-Xylan "(1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is uncommon. In most cases it is decorated with additional sugars, in the form of |FRAME: Arabinoxylan arabinoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans glucuronoxylan|, |FRAME: Glucuronoarabinoxylans glucuronoarabinoxylan| or |FRAME: Arabinoglucuronoxylans arabinoglucuronoxylan|.
/
/The secondary hydroxyl groups on xylose carbons 2 and 3 can be substituted by a number of residues, the type and degree of substitution depending on xylan's botanical source. Arabinose and glucuronic acid are linked to the backbone by glycosidic bonds. Other substituents form ester bonds: acetate groups are bound directly to the backbone, while cinnamoyl (feruloyl and coumaroyl) residues are linked to the side chain arabinoses |CITS: [JOSELEAU]|.
/
/Due to its heterogeneous structure, the biodegradation of xylan requires the concerted action of a complex set of enzymes |CITS: [17008082]|. These enzymes are mainly extracellular and are secreted by numerous fungi and bacteria |CITS: [BIELY]|. The endoxylanases and &beta; xylosidases hydrolyze the main chain; the former generating short chain oligosaccharides and the latter acting on these products to liberate xylose. The side chains are hydrolyzed by glycanases, &alpha;-glucuronidases, acetyl xylan esterases and feruloyl esterases |CITS: [11729262]|.
/
/|FRAME: 13-BETA-D-XYLANS "(1->3)-&beta;-D-xylan"| is found only in cell walls of some red and green algae.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Xyloglucan
TYPES - Hemicelluloses
COMMON-NAME - a xyloglucan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Xyloglucan Xyloglucan| is the major component of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| in cell walls of dicotyledon type I and non-graminaceous monocotyledon plants. It also exists in some seeds of trees growing in the tropical zone.
/
/Xyloglucan interacts with cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonds to form a structural network that is assumed to play a key role in cell wall integrity. Cross-linking between the xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the resulting three-dimensional matrix |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/Xyloglucan has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked glucose residues, most of which are substituted in C-6 by &alpha;-D-xylosyl residues |CITS: [8252539]|. In most plants some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues, and some of the galactosyl residues are capped by (1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|. Other types of xyloglucans, for example those found in the Poaeceae and Solanaceae, feature xylose units that bear &alpha;-L-arabinosyl instead of &beta;-D-galactosyl residues.
/
/A common terminology uses G for basic non-substituted glucosyl units within a xylosylglycan, X for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, L for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose and &beta;-D-galactose, and F for glucose residues substituted by &alpha;-D-xylose, &beta;-D-galactose and &alpha;-L-fucose |CITS:[Fry93]|.
/Fucosyl residues are typically absent from seed xyloglucans but present on the xyloglucans in the vegatative portions of the same plant |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/Most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide |FRAME: Xyloglucans-Xylose XXXG| units. The average molecular weight of xyloglucan is more than 50,000  |CITS: [Mishra09]|.
/
/A common form of xyloglucan that is often used in enzyme assays is produced from tamarind (|FRAME: TAX-58860|) seeds.

UNIQUE-ID - Mucin-type-glycans
TYPES - O-N-acetylgalactosamine-Glycans
COMMON-NAME - a mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycan
COMMENT - <i>O</i>-Linked glycans are polysaccharide or oligosaccharide that are linked to a protein via the oxygen atom in the side chain of a |FRAME: SER| or |FRAME: THR| residue.
/Most commonly <i>O</i>-glycosylation begins with the attachment of |FRAME: CPD-3604| to the free hydroxyl group of the amino acid, although O-linkages to fucose, glucose, mannose, xylose and other sugars are known. In eukaryotes, <i>O</i>-linked glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus one sugar at a time, while attached to the core protein.
/
/Mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycosylation, consisting of glycans attached via O-linked |FRAME: CPD-3604|, is one of the most abundant forms of protein glycosylation in animals. Eight core-type structures of mucin-type <i>O</i>-glycans have been proposed, including |FRAME: Core1 "core 1"|, |FRAME: Core2 "core 2"|, |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINYL-13-N-ETCETERA-GALACTOSAMINY "core 3"|, |FRAME: GLUCOSAMINYL-16-ETCETERA-GALACTOSAMINYL- "core 4"|, |FRAME: Core5 "core 5"|, |FRAME: Core6 "core 6"|, |FRAME: Core7 "core 7"| and |FRAME: Core8 "core 8"| |CITS: [16413314]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - HEPARIN
TYPES - Glucosaminoglycans
COMMON-NAME - heparin
COMMENT - |FRAME: HEPARIN "Heparin"| is a glycosaminoglycan polymer with a molecular weight ranging from 3 to 30 kDa. It is composed of a variable sulfated repeating disaccharide units composed of hexuronic (either iduronic or glucuronic) acid and glucosamine residues, in which the 2 position of the hexuronic acid and the 2, 3, or 6 positions of glucosamine may be sulfated. The two residuces within a disaccharide are linked by a (1->4) bond, as are the disaccharides to each other.
/
/The main disaccharide unit consists of |FRAME: CPD-12518| and |FRAME: CPD-12533| [it is often referred to as IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S)]. However, |FRAME: CPD-12518| can be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12521|, and |FRAME: CPD-12533| can be replaced by |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE|, |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine|, |FRAME: CPD-12545| or |FRAME: CPD-12565|.
/
/The basic IdoA(2S)-(1->4)-GlcNS(6S) disaccharide accounts for at least 85% of heparin isolated from beef lung and about 75% of heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa |CITS: [Casu89][Gatti79]|.
/
/Variations in the extent and location of sulfation, as well as the conformation of the alternating hexuronic acid residues, lead to a high degree of heterogeneity. By convention, heparin refers to molecules which possess a high sulfate content and large amounts of iduronic acid.
/
/The structure of |FRAME: HEPARIN| is very similar to that of |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| (also known as heparitin sulfate). Heparan sulfate contains lower amounts of sulfate and less iduronic acid than heparin |CITS: [5484472]|. In addition, heparan sulfates disaccharide units are organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains, while heparin disaccharides are sulfated more uniformly |CITS: [15047699]|.

COMMON-NAME - heparan sulfate
COMMENT - |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate "Heparan sulfate"| (also known as heparitin sulfate)  is a member of the |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| family. It consists of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide unit composed of a hexuronic acid and a hexosamine.
/The most common repeating unit, which makes up around 50% of the total disaccharide units in heparan sulfate, is composed of |FRAME: CPD-12521| linked to |FRAME: CPD-12541|. In other units |FRAME: CPD-12521| may be substituted by |FRAME: CPD-12515| or its sulfated form |FRAME: CPD-12518|, and |FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| may be sulfated to |FRAME: CPD-12565|, or may be substituted by |FRAME: N-sulfo-D-glucosamine| or |FRAME: CPD-12533|.
/
/Heparan sulfate binds to specific proteins such as antithrombin and several growth factors, thereby regulating various biological processes including anticoagulation and angiogenesis |CITS: [9151776]|. The unique sulfation pattern of a monosaccharide sequence within HS is believed to be critical for binding to the target protein.
/
/The structure of heparan sulfate is very similar to that of |FRAME: HEPARIN|. Heparan sulfate contains lower amounts of sulfate and less iduronic acid than heparin |CITS: [5484472]|. In addition, heparan sulfates disaccharide units are organized into distinct sulfated and non-sulfated domains, while heparin disaccharides are sulfated randomly |CITS: [15047699]|. |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate "Heparan sulfate"| chains comprise three different types of domains: S-domains that contain contiguous <i>N</i>-sulfated residues, unmodified <i>N</i>-acetyl-rich regions, and mixed transition zones between the S-domains and the unmodified segments. Only the S-domains have binding capacities for growth factors and other proteins |CITS: [11489926]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Hyaluronan Hyaluronan| is an anionic, nonsulfated |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans "glycosaminoglycan"| distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues, including the vitreous humor of the eye, the aorta, blood, brain, liver and skin |CITS: [354500]|. It is produced by almost all members of the animal kingdom as well as by certain members of streptococci |CITS: [9260563]|. Hyaluronan can be very large, with its molecular weight often reaching the millions. It forms a strikingly viscous solution and functions primarily as a joint lubricant and shock absorber, although it is also thought to be involved in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.
/
/Hyaluronan is composed of repeating disaccharide unit of [|FRAME: N-ACETYL-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (&beta;1,4) |FRAME: CPD-12521|] (|FRAME: HYALURONATE|) linked by &beta; 1,3 linkages. 
/
/Though classified as a glycosaminoglycan, it differs from other members of this family. While all other glycosaminoglycans are synthesized by resident Golgi enzymes and covalently attached to core proteins, hyaluronan is synthesized at the inner face of the plasma membrane as a free linear polymer without any protein core. In addition, it is the only glycosaminoglycan that is not sulfated |CITS: [17408700]|.

TYPES - Peptidoglycans
COMMON-NAME - a peptidoglycan with (L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine) pentapeptide
COMMENT - The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmpspheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria. This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as "basal structure", "mucopeptide", "glycopeptide", "glycosaminopeptide" and "murein").
/
/Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.

COMMENT - Xyloglucan is the major hemicellulose in dicotyledon type I cell walls and has a backbone of &beta;-1,4-linked cellotetraose units, which are substituted in C-6 by a-D-xylosyl residues at two or three of the first three glucosyl residues (from the reducing end) |CITS: [8252539]|. Some of the xylosyl residues are further substituted by galactosyl, arabinosyl or fucosyls residues |CITS: [Fry93]|. The cross-linking between xyloglucan chains is a major factor in the stability of the three-dimensional matrix between adjacent cellulose microfibrils |CITS: [Whitney95]|.
/
/
/A common terminology refers to a glucosyl unit within a xylosylglycan as G and to a glucose residues substituted by D-xylose in a (1,6)-&alpha;-linkage as X.
/Using this terminology, most xylosylglucans consist of repeating heptasaccharide XXXG units.
/Subsequently (1,2)-&beta;-D-galactosyl residues are added at the second and/or third xylose residue and an(1,2)-&alpha;-L-fucose is added at the galactosyl unit of the third xylose residue |CITS:[12837954] [17011813]|.

/and the storage of iron and sulfur.
/In addition, they act as sensors of iron, dioxygen, the superoxide ion, and possibly nitric oxide, and participate
/in gene expression |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/[4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters feature four iron ions and four sulfide ions placed at the vertices of a cubane-type structure.  The Fe centers are typically further coordinated by cysteinyl ligands.

COMMENT - Elongator tRNA<sup>met</sup> is a |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| used for extending a nascent peptide by an |FRAME: MET| residue. It differs from |FRAME: Initiation-tRNAmet|, which is involved in translation initiation.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in |FRAME: mRNAs mRNA| during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the terminal phosphate group of a CCA motif present at the 3'-end of the tRNA. More specifically, the phosphate is attached to position 5 of the ribose of the terminal adenine ribonucleotide of the tRNA. This covalent attachment is catalyzed by dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases |CITS: [10966471]|. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/The structure shown here depicts the phosphate group at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule, which binds the amino acid (in the form of an amino-acyl group).

COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c550</i> is an essential component of the quinoprotein ethanol oxidation system that occurs in <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i>.
/
/The gene encoding the cytochrome, which was named exaB, has been studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The deduced amino acid sequence of that gene showed some similarity to cytochrome c6 of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and to the heme binding  domain of quinohaemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases of acetic acid bacteria |CITS: [10075429]|.

COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome <i>c552</i>
COMMENT - The cytochrome <i>c552</i> family includes periplasmic cytochromes that function in nitrite reduction in Gram-negative bacteria such as enteric bacteria, Shewanella and Vibrio.
/The enzyme, which is encoded by the nrfA gene, covalently binds five |FRAME: HEME_C| groups and one |FRAME: CA+2| ion per monomer |CITS: [9593308]|.
/
/It is believed that the cytochrome <i>c</i> encoded by the nrfB gene is responsible for the direct transfer of electrons to cytochrome <i>c552</i>.  The reduced cytochrome <i>c552</i> can then directly reduce nitrite to ammonia.
/Formate, pyruvate, ethanol, and D-lactate can serve as electron donors |CITS: [5338848][6381645][8409924] [7934939] [8057835][8039676]|.
/
/The cytochrome <i>c552</i> from |FRAME: TAX-915| is a misnamed 9.1-kDa monoheme protein and does not belong to this family. It belongs to the cytochrome <i>c551</i> |CITS: [9746537]|.

COMMON-NAME - a cytochrome <i>c554</i>
COMMENT - The tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17537| from |FRAME: TAX-915| contains one high-spin and three low-spin c-type hemes. The main role of the protein is to accept pairs of electrons from |FRAME: CPLX-1321| (HAO) and transfer them to a cytochrome acceptor, the tetraheme |FRAME: MONOMER-17538| |CITS: [4372235]|.
/
/In addition, it has been shown that the protein also has significant nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. Ferrous cytochrome <i>c</i>554 reduced NO at a rate greater than 16 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is comparable to rates of other known NO reductases |CITS: [16569009]|.
/
/The cycA gene that encodes the enzyme was identified by reverse translation of amino acid sequence obtained from peptides produced by proteolysis of the N-terminal region of the protein |CITS: [8195067]|. The sequencing of the complete genome revealed that three copies of the gene are present in the organism, named |FRAME: G-15261|, |FRAME: G-15266| and |FRAME: G-15267| |CITS: [12700255]|.

TYPES - Red-Alage-Galactans
COMMON-NAME - a porphyran
COMMENT - Porphyran is a sulfated carbohydrate extracted from the cell wall of red seaweeds belonging to the genus |FRAME: TAX-2784| |CITS: [Anderson65]|. Unlike |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| and |FRAME: Carrageenans carrageenan|, porphyran is not utilized as ingredient for its gelling or texturizing properties. However, it is one of the most consumed algal polysaccharides because it is the main component of edible |FRAME: TAX-2788| and |FRAME: TAX-2785|, both of which are extensively used in the preparation of sushi |CITS: [Correc11]|.
/
/The backbone of porphyran is composed of about 30% of |FRAME: Agaroses agarose| repeating units (1,3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose followed by 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-&alpha;-L-galactopyranose), with the remaining residues being 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose and 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate. The 4-linked &alpha;-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate residues can be converted to |FRAME: CPD-13430| by the enzyme |FRAME: 2.5.1.5-RXN "galactose-6-sulfurylase, EC 2.5.1.5"|.
/
/In addition, the galactan backboned is decorated by methyl-ether groups at the C6 position of the 3-linked &beta;-D-galactopyranose residues.
/
/As other sulfated galactans, porphyran may have some potential pharmacological applications |CITS: [18796647]|, based on, for example, its hypolipidemic |CITS: [19202270]| and anti-allergic properties |CITS: [16244430]|.

COMMON-NAME - a partially acetylated chitosan
COMMENT - Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed &beta;-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units.
/Chitosan is found in the cell walls of some phytopathogenic fungi. The natural occuring chitosan has a degree of acetylation between 20-30%, with the acetyl residues grouped into clusters.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycogens
TYPES - Alpha-D-Glucans
COMMON-NAME - a glycogen
COMMENT - Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer that serves as a form of energy storage in animals and fungi. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called "animal starch".
/
/Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 710% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.
/
/Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).
/Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal value for the particle size above which further growth is impossible as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. This generates a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter including 55 000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.
/
/Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Pectin
TYPES - Modified-Galacturonans
COMMON-NAME - a pectin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Pectin "Pectin"| is a structural heteropolysaccharide consisting of a complex set of polysaccharides that is present in most primary cell walls and is particularly abundant in the non-woody parts of terrestrial plants. It s involved in crosslinking cellulose and hemicellulose fibers, which provides rigidity to the cell wall.
/The characteristic structure of pectin is a linear chain of &alpha;-(1-4)-linked |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| that forms the pectin-backbone, |FRAME: 1-4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl|.
/
/Diferent types of pectin have different substitutions and additions.
/A common type is |FRAME: Rhamnogalacturonans-I "rhamnogalacturonan I"|, where some |FRAME: D-GALACTURONATE| units are replaced by (1-2)-linked |FRAME: L-rhamnose|, to which side chains of various neutral sugars branch off, mostly |FRAME: D-Galactose|, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| and |FRAME: XYLOSE|.
/
/In nature, around 80% of the carboxyl groups of the galacturonate units are esterified with |FRAME: METOH|.
/Some plants, including sugar beet, potatoes and pears, contain pectins with acetylated galacturonate in addition to
/methyl esters. 
/
/The salt of partially esterified pectins is called a pectinate, and if the degree of esterification is below 5%,
/|FRAME: PECTATE|.
/
/Pectin is used in the animal feed industry and in the food industry as a gelling agent.  Phytopathogenic and saprophytic bacteria and fungi can produce variety of extracellular and intracellular enzymes that degrade pectin and its derivatives.  Pectinolytic enzymes such as esterases, hydrolases and lyases, are used in the food, fiber and animal feed industries.  There is commercial interest in pectinolytic enzymes to convert the pectin-rich by-products from citrus peel and sugar beet processing to higher value material.

TYPES - Plant-Arabinogalactans
COMMON-NAME - a plant arabinogalactan type I
COMMENT - Arabinogalactans (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.
/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG of type I has a linear (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone, bearing 20-40% of &alpha;-L-Araf residues (1&rarr;5)-linked in short chains, in general at position 3. It is commonly found in pectins from citrus, apple and potato. Type I AG has been isolated from the skin of Opuntia ficus indica pear fruits |CITS: [15063212]|.

/
/AGs occur in two structurally different forms described as |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I "type I"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II "type II"|.
/
/AG type II, known as arabino-3,6-galactan, has a (1&rarr;3)-&beta;-D-Galp backbone heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans|CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AGt contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.
/
/AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|. However, larch AG type II is located in the lumen of the tracheids and ray cells, and is thus not a cell-wall component and by definition, not part of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| of these trees.

/<b>About phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P):</b>
/
/Several studies found changes in intracellular PI5P levels during cell cycle progression, as well as upon thrombin treatment and osmotic stress |CITS: [10854858][11463365][11716778]|. The plant homeodomain-containing ING2 protein, a candidate tumor suppressor, was shown to act as a nuclear PI5P receptor, a function that regulates its ability to activate p53 |CITS: [12859901]|. PI5P has also been tied to tumor suppression via its potential regulation of Akt. It was demonstrated that the loss of PI5P, via a conversion to |FRAME: PHOSPHATIDYL-MYO-INOSITOL-45-BISPHOSPHA|, resulted in a decrease in Akt activity |CITS: [12897244]|. In addition, PI5P was shown to enhance the activity of various myotubularin phosphatases (MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6) toward their preferred substrate |FRAME: 1-PHOSPHATIDYL-1D-MYO-INOSITOL-35-BISPH|, presumably through allosteric regulation |CITS: [12646134]|). Together these studies stress the importance of PI5P as a bona fide signaling molecule |CITS: [15247229]|.

TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.
/
/Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

COMMON-NAME - an osmoregulated periplasmic glucan with phosphoglycerol substituent
COMMENT - Osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs), formerly known as membrane derived oligosaccharides (MDOs), represent a class of periplasmic oligosaccharides occuring in Gram-negative bacteria and implicated in osmoregulation.
/
/Cyclic, branched, and open-chain variants have been found, usually containing in the order of a dozen D-glucose units.
/The MDO of |FRAME: TAX-562| constitute a closely related family of compounds containing about 8-10 glucose units in a highly branched structure linked by &beta;-1&rarr;2 and &beta;1&rarr;6 bonds.
/
/The glucose residues are substituted with various amounts of <i>sn</i>-1-phosphoglycerol and smaller amounts of phosphoethanolamine residues in phosphodiester linkage on the 6 position of certain of the glucose residues. Some species of membrane-derived oligosaccharide also contain succinate in O-ester linkage |CITS: [6272307]|.

COMMON-NAME - a 2-<i>O</i>-&alpha;-D-galactopyranosyl-4-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-D-glucurono)-D-xylan
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glucuronoxylans Glucuronoxylans| are a component of |FRAME: Hemicelluloses|. They are linear polymers of &beta;-D-xylopyranosyl units linked by (1&rarr;4) glycosidic bonds, with many of the xylose units substituted with 2,2 or 2,3-linked glucuronate residue, which are often methylated at position 4.
/Most of the glucuronoxylans have single 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl uronate residues (MeGlcA) attached at position 2. This structural type is usually named as 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-D-glucurono-D-xylan (MGX).
/
/An unusual heteroxylan in which some of the glucurunosyl residues are further substituted at position O-2 by |FRAME: ALPHA-D-GALACTOSE| has been reported from the wood of |FRAME: TAX-34317| |CITS: [10515063]|.
